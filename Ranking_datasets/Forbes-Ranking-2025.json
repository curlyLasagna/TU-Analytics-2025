As the fourth oldest college in the United States, Princeton has a deep history that spans 276 years.

Princeton provides generous financial aid, covering 100% of tuition and housing for families earning up to $65,000 for the class of 2026. In 2022, Princeton reported an endowment valued at $35.8 billion to help fund university-wide research, service programs, and financial aid to help students graduate debt free. Campus traditions allow Ivy League sports rivalries to live on—students celebrate defeating Harvard and Yale in the same season by creating a bonfire by burning crates decorated with the rival team’s colors and logos.

The school’s robust research initiatives allow students and faculty to work closely with NASA, having been awarded $5 million in 2022 to support NASA’s Artemis mission to produce a virtual recreation of the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. Students can maintain involvement through one of the school’s 450+ student clubs and organizations. A significant portion of student life lies in athletics, where the LSU Tigers are on full display. As of 2023, the LSU Tigers have collectively earned over 50 National Championships, with 46 NCAA-sponsored national titles under their belt. Surrounded by lakes, many LSU students enjoy nature, stroll through “the Quad'' on campus, or see Mike the Tiger— LSU’s live mascot. Some of LSU’s most recognizable alumni include basketball hall of famer Shaquille O'Neal, NFL player Odell Beckham Jr., and current Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards.","organizationName":"Louisiana State University","state":"LA","schoolSize":"large","studentPopulation":39475,"academics":{"type":"Public","carnegieClassification":"Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity","studentFacultyRatio":"22","totalStudentPopulation":39475,"undergraduatePopulation":31458,"attendanceStatus":[{"key":"partTime","value":16.0},{"key":"fullTime","value":84.0}],"firstToSecondYearRetention":[{"key":"fullTime","value":84.0},{"key":"partTime","value":50.0}],"overallGraduationRates":[{"key":"4","value":44.0},{"key":"6","value":67.0}],"enrollmentByGender":[{"key":"enrollmentMale","value":44.0},{"key":"enrollmentFemale","value":56.0},{"key":"AgeUnder18","value":11.0},{"key":"Age18to24","value":85.0},{"key":"Age25to64","value":4.0},{"key":"Age65andOver","value":0.0}],"graduationRateByGender":[{"key":"graduationMale","value":65.0},{"key":"graduationFemale","value":74.0}],"enrollmentByRace":[{"key":"americanIndian","value":0.6},{"key":"asian","value":4.4},{"key":"hawaiianPacific","value":0.1},{"key":"africanAmerican","value":15.9},{"key":"hispanic","value":7.8},{"key":"white","value":63.8},{"key":"twoRaces","value":1.9},{"key":"unknown","value":1.3},{"key":"alien","value":4.2}],"graduationRateByRace":[{"key":"americanIndian","value":61.0},{"key":"asian","value":74.0},{"key":"hawaiianPacific","value":71.0},{"key":"africanAmerican","value":58.0},{"key":"hispanic","value":67.0},{"key":"white","value":72.0},{"key":"twoRaces","value":69.0},{"key":"unknown","value":50.0},{"key":"alien","value":79.0}]},"financialAid":{"totalGrantAid":8.5602923E7,"percentOfStudentsFinAid":98.0,"percentOfStudentsGrant":98.0,"grantAidByType":[{"key":"federalGrant","value":98.0},{"key":"pellGrant","value":30.0},{"key":"otherFederalGrant","value":98.0},{"key":"stateLocalGrant","value":62.0},{"key":"institutionalGrant","value":74.0}],"avgGrantAidByType":[{"key":"anyGrant","value":12374.0},{"key":"federalGrant","value":2225.0},{"key":"pellGrant","value":5187.0},{"key":"otherFederalGrant","value":661.0},{"key":"stateLocalGrant","value":7311.0},{"key":"institutionalGrant","value":7385.0}],"loansByType":[{"key":"anyLoan","value":32.0},{"key":"federalLoan","value":30.0},{"key":"nonFederalLoan","value":5.0}],"avgLoansByType":[{"key":"anyLoan","value":8404.0},{"key":"federalLoan","value":5517.0},{"key":"nonFederalLoan","value":21922.0}]},"campusSetting":"Urban","medianBaseSalary":119500.0,"squareImage":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/559c39ebe4b05c2c3431bb71/416x416.jpg?background=000000&cropX1=0&cropX2=416&cropY1=0&cropY2=416"},{"uri":"kenyon-college","rank":140,"description":"Founded in 1824, Kenyon College is the oldest private college in Ohio.
