Many of us are part-time or working professionals who may not be local, and having accessible housing options would make a significant difference in supporting our academic journey.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-18T01:13:24.350096Z","guid":"83e6d92b-76e5-4c86-b7e0-5cc37f208460","helpfulness":5,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d5147d0c750c61e390b85c36d8ca33b647f560ee","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7b4614d65ccf83bec0fc185e0933ea793b47a371","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d5147d0c750c61e390b85c36d8ca33b647f560ee","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6485f7fe4af9e24d69cc790cae6c242738881f7d"},"guid":"f8a1a580-b2c2-4896-937d-218f39164e24","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.118177,42.374429,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.118177,42.374429,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"edb02423-fd6d-4f4d-8a41-710c9d5ecf70","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.158675799086758,"count":876},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/explore-harvard/virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=harvard-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/explore-harvard/virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"269d6b14-4af9-4c94-8c96-13767d623a41","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":5,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.70408,"lon":-72.289951},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Dartmouth","alternates":{"ceeb":"3351","ipeds":"182670"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"269d6b14-4af9-4c94-8c96-13767d623a41","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"HANOVER, NH","name":"Dartmouth College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"cd50ef7c-df6d-4981-903d-5133180fe672","gradSchool":"c69feecc-6c96-4925-94eb-45e8043c556d","state":"a1706a79-1bcf-45f6-9a7f-d501aabffa81","town":"7df70ed4-4e57-4203-af3f-b0f3d86792b2","zipCode":"90b71152-d982-4b29-8264-ae7456d47adf"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Dartmouth","tagline":["4 Year","HANOVER, NH"],"type":"College","url":"dartmouth-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.06380575945793338},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19208},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1500-1580"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Dartmouth is simply the most wonderful undergraduate experience I could imagine. \nI’m from a large city and attended a public high school where people rarely went off to schools like Dartmouth. When I first arrived on campus, I was nervous. Since then, I’ve found an incredibly beautiful and caring community made up of remarkable individuals. Dartmouth has everything you’d expect it to: incredible faculty, small, (sometimes extremely) rigorous classes, excellent facilities, and an endless number of academic and career opportunities. It also has a many things you wouldn’t expect: its own skiway, outdoor lodges, countless traditions, and a very active social life, to name a few. The result is an experience where you live and learn in an incredibly enriching community, all in the pristine backdrop of the Upper Valley. In every sense, it lives up to its ascribed ideal of the “College on the Hill”.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-21T16:36:59.711003Z","guid":"173e6fc1-8004-4fad-ae71-c2f5c5803657","helpfulness":7,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d73967e37016f5858df91529193eae6d30f22606.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ecc235286b9c57c0ac9a33040610e2fe52834921.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d73967e37016f5858df91529193eae6d30f22606.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/89a83a69ed635fc0a5b86149913ebc090d4269a8"},"guid":"f1f80a85-a97b-4392-a2bc-21e932f607d2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.289951,43.70408,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.289951,43.70408,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"8f8cc645-081f-453f-9f83-54f84d71e0a8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.894875164257556,"count":761},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dartmouth-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=dartmouth-college"}]},{"guid":"b6a1648c-7760-4bb0-a11f-fe8696c9c50b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":6,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.808286,"lon":-73.961885},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Columbia","alternates":{"ceeb":"2116","ipeds":"190150"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b6a1648c-7760-4bb0-a11f-fe8696c9c50b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEW YORK, NY","name":"Columbia University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"510ffa3e-a740-4fc0-9626-13343de3d1f0","gradSchool":"9a43e191-567c-47a8-9ce6-0fb5de260feb","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"970d8343-408b-422c-9258-1061df31dda3","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"be4375aa-a7b8-433d-9864-a8f40bc9dcc1","zipCode":"3a201fa9-2d4e-47bc-80a6-714612e6c48f"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Columbia","tagline":["4 Year","NEW YORK, NY"],"type":"College","url":"columbia-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.03951439332795265},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":22058},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1490-1580"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Columbia University is not for the faint-hearted.

The academic courses are challenging but the Open Curriculum encourages students to pursue their passions rather than a common core, and the professors are extremely accommodating and enthusiastic about what they teach!\n\nBrown's most significant area of improvement is its housing. Likely due to budget overspending, there are sometimes instances where housing conditions are subpar (forced triples, repeatedly broken heating and elevators).

The campus is stunning, and the vibrant community creates an environment that fosters collaboration and innovation.\n\nOne of the things I truly appreciate about Duke is its interdisciplinary focus. Whether through specialized courses, research opportunities, or extracurricular activities, students are encouraged to break traditional academic boundaries. Organizations like the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative or programs like Bass Connections allow for hands-on experiences that prepare you for real-world challenges.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-26T15:58:41.048491Z","guid":"9a942cf3-4e70-454b-b1a3-61756a837d6f","helpfulness":12,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/223df5840d575a2c6c8492f76e6dbe6347654dc2","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ad902699b4d99ea03a89254c270a557f847e6e1","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/89894b820f771e2fd3eeb4111b813f71850a8f24","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/da3951be59456d976e8ed03c26625c86b20c31d2"},"guid":"5ca9fcd5-8e3f-4e11-8c5c-8566b48253bc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-03T16:17:14.772532Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e0039721d51514b73e6d4ea029a62bcfd97c257"},"guid":"8c1f195a-d1b9-4e52-8884-f6c5564d187e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-09-09T15:56:33.985256Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.9331087,35.9984995,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.9331087,35.9984995,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"0449d65c-0713-45ca-9a02-326e23d927ef","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9478827361563518,"count":1228},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/duke"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/duke-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=duke-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/duke"}]},{"guid":"34af6312-6f20-4d90-b512-ac5cd720ab25","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":13,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.908809,"lon":-77.073463},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Georgetown","alternates":{"ceeb":"5244","ipeds":"131496"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"34af6312-6f20-4d90-b512-ac5cd720ab25","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"WASHINGTON, DC","name":"Georgetown University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d73df838-83ae-47ca-82f0-0f68c06ac7c7","gradSchool":"18e127f8-8ad1-460a-8679-d235790a8da7","metroArea":"1cd9901c-6cda-4d97-a26e-e3b24e3f25cb","neighborhood":"7300b9e9-c589-4800-860f-8a718db797a6","state":"d8812b16-d311-48fc-882d-56a7a6f186d4","town":"f88fc330-6f67-485b-b3a0-e2b37c14ca23","zipCode":"f475b899-ae27-4870-8c92-33033dad4953"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Georgetown","tagline":["4 Year","WASHINGTON, DC"],"type":"College","url":"georgetown-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.12242424242424242},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":35566},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1410-1560"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Georgetown is a world class university.

Academics are tough, but professors genuinely care and are accessible. Collaboration is encouraged, making even the hardest classes manageable. The campus is beautiful, and Forest Park next door is a huge plus. Social life depends on how much you put yourself out there—there are tons of clubs, student events, and a mix of Greek life and non-Greek activities. Dorms are nice, and while the food is decent, it could be better. The workload is intense, but support is available through tutoring, office hours, and wellness programs. The WashU bubble is real, but St. Louis has great places to explore if you make the effort. The student body is diverse but leans wealthy, which can sometimes be noticeable. Overall, WashU is a rigorous but rewarding place, and if you find balance between academics and social life, it can be an amazing experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-07T23:40:00.893936Z","guid":"316c0a9a-34cb-44b3-b9f0-4a2a8db728a6","helpfulness":3,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/266dddde75a72c9efef8fcc12640e4697e26d984","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3694ae7cca8edba46c71256b824aad6fe326334c","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/416c317581dbf940c1c8ecc5e5fa78fd18f578eb","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/010dc56f21085195afbebd71ee020bf1a525df3a"},"guid":"4ba73691-9bd6-47cf-9381-1ba7945c630e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-19T16:16:16.37876Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1e536b900fd716a4b4f5765b8074f8bb88926856"},"guid":"2c99e5e9-716e-4521-95dd-b4548bd92c43","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-19T15:57:44.102774Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.311639,38.648125,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.311639,38.648125,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"ac55da07-4297-426d-9d36-f416857a228b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/36813f049f5c7b33659323a8986ba0f410c9e42f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/510bcb9d1250a417ad24b98551ae0f7fee040a84"},"guid":"56eb4e72-8d2f-4e43-8dd6-757c6ea53152","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-16T21:46:30.827564Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.117133956386293,"count":1605},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/wustl/139513"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington-university-in-st-louis/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=washington-university-in-st-louis"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/wustl/139513"}]},{"guid":"1a78b6e5-fe24-443a-967d-40079fd070ff","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":16,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.0971192,"lon":-117.7131911},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Pomona","alternates":{"ceeb":"4607","ipeds":"121345"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"1a78b6e5-fe24-443a-967d-40079fd070ff","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CLAREMONT, CA","name":"Pomona College","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ca304750-4dd6-4876-a481-47931f45c082","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","parent":"ca304750-4dd6-4876-a481-47931f45c082","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"fc0052e4-4aa2-46da-946b-470ed8533b2e","zipCode":"50f4ce28-79b1-4045-bd89-233424943937"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Pomona","tagline":["4 Year","CLAREMONT, CA"],"type":"College","url":"pomona-college","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.07025607353906763},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19962},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1480-1560"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As time passes, I am increasingly sure that Pomona was the perfect college for me.

Prior to college, I had heard from everyone that all Pomona students raved about the school, and this has proven true in my experience -- everyone is SO happy to be here. While no school is without its faults, Pomona's few weaknesses are easy to embrace in the grander scheme of its seemingly infinite benefits.

Looking back as a recent alum, I’m incredibly grateful for the wide range of experiences I had and the exposure to so many different aspects of college life. Northwestern really brings together the best of so many worlds—top-tier academics, Big Ten athletics, a Midwestern campus with an elite school culture, access to a major city, a scenic lakeside setting, and a tight-knit college town. \n\nI also found the people I met to be not only intelligent and capable but genuinely kind. The culture at Northwestern isn’t perfect, but it leans collaborative, and most students are there to help each other succeed. One of the things that makes NU special is its strength across so many disciplines, which fosters a unique and dynamic environment. While the intermingling between different fields doesn’t always happen naturally, with a little effort, you can meet some truly incredible people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-12T19:48:34.854824Z","guid":"0a69c442-6d38-4bc2-86d6-83633947d673","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ejojola","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b7492bc80d986826d01503deb309e7bb25c1ef13.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ecffae88eb638f3f8e5d9a683b557be333846b62.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b7492bc80d986826d01503deb309e7bb25c1ef13.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/46356a9a4b34266703c552d29b73c721c0836ec0"},"guid":"f41ee213-cd1b-47ee-8038-dc578f43e428","licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ejojola/3769200519/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.673653,42.058377,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.673653,42.058377,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5ca1a488-ee2e-4382-8d46-2e03fa654d0f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7146596858638743,"count":1528},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwestern-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=northwestern-university"}]},{"guid":"d8a17c0f-cc25-4d2a-b231-0303ea016427","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":18,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.444616,"lon":-79.942914},"entity":{"abbreviation":"CMU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2074","ipeds":"211440"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d8a17c0f-cc25-4d2a-b231-0303ea016427","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PITTSBURGH, PA","name":"Carnegie Mellon University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"eebe21fb-3bc4-44a1-8c96-a465d0442acb","gradSchool":"6e334045-0858-4fd2-90d3-b4ee267fa82a","metroArea":"15cc22ec-ecaf-411f-ac7a-8665d6adeb3a","neighborhood":"712b986e-690e-4952-aa9e-0a1549264752","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"56f000ed-ce4a-4636-a0bf-4fe70e652684","zipCode":"b720bee5-79e0-42bb-af9a-7127637a5f28"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Carnegie Mellon","tagline":["4 Year","PITTSBURGH, PA"],"type":"College","url":"carnegie-mellon-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.11304398587315023},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33499},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1490-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I studied within the College of Fine Arts and received a BFA.

The student life is also varied and there is something for everyone. There were a few misses in terms of professors, but by and large, all of my professors were at base-line chill, and invested in your learning and growth.

One of the things I loved most was the school spirit—going to football and basketball games was always a highlight, and the energy on game days is unmatched. The sense of community is strong, and it’s easy to feel connected to campus through the many student organizations and clubs. With such a large student body, there’s always an opportunity to meet new people and get involved in different activities.\n\nAcademically, the university offers rigorous and high-quality programs with great professors and resources. However, one thing I wish would change is the timing of exams—having tests right after breaks often means spending break time studying instead of actually resting. Another challenge is registering for classes, as popular courses fill up quickly, making it difficult to get into the ones you really want. A more efficient registration system would definitely improve the experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-04T15:15:06.365531Z","guid":"4da9c981-c1fe-4ed1-abc0-20262b9f0a82","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a6bfc1fbc3dcc9c57230e75eea3b29cc9228ca28","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d710c21df84b0a5f676996933a7b290755577df2","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a6bfc1fbc3dcc9c57230e75eea3b29cc9228ca28","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c234b677701b2c8162165a34111f79e51ea24f11"},"guid":"501e472f-45fe-45dc-9dee-dd73eb620dda","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.7425712,42.2767295,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.7425712,42.2767295,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"cc3b60bd-88a5-436d-9f13-17692298c8dc","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9763860369609856,"count":4870},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-michigan-ann-arbor/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-michigan-ann-arbor"}]},{"guid":"dae7241a-4d00-4c50-b1a5-f33baf3a6c3b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":24,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.1021,"lon":-117.713},"entity":{"abbreviation":"CMC","alternates":{"ceeb":"4054","ipeds":"112260"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"dae7241a-4d00-4c50-b1a5-f33baf3a6c3b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CLAREMONT, CA","name":"Claremont McKenna College","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ca304750-4dd6-4876-a481-47931f45c082","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","gradSchool":"730c2f52-0c53-486b-9fef-b18853aa4aa1","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","parent":"ca304750-4dd6-4876-a481-47931f45c082","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"fc0052e4-4aa2-46da-946b-470ed8533b2e","zipCode":"50f4ce28-79b1-4045-bd89-233424943937"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Claremont McKenna","tagline":["4 Year","CLAREMONT, CA"],"type":"College","url":"claremont-mckenna-college","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.10352075669994745},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":28701},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1440-1550"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Claremont McKenna College has truly exceeded my expectations in my first semester.

I would definitely like to see a renewed push to promote house culture so students could be more involved with it on a regular basis, have new clubs open up that solely seek to promote socializing among students of similar academic dispositions or interests (like it would be great if there was a History Club that focused entirely on discussing history, watching documentaries, doing activities, etc.).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-16T16:08:52.426058Z","guid":"a632d3fc-9126-40a6-adc8-bcc41094be99","helpfulness":2,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff479a3ed29ee0268e94bbf0b257db9612f8beae","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/87b507d14a87e29a237a42d772e5c8087e0f7ab1","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efa0018b1d20873f08ef0d1d178f04a3ee773f84","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0bc2e55e697f7556e8b9bd2a805ecf6104855d7"},"guid":"85a8a0a5-b39a-4412-b2e9-4b8759b799fe","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-05-30T19:54:54.38111Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/147ef91df9bfab78d52594e0d6ee770194cc0815"},"guid":"8008de0d-c631-41df-97db-d2cf4479245a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-05T20:09:15.110359Z"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a463bdb16249ff5846c3b9df8a648be49732b8b","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1a905fd1e03ef91a0c3d142fd9f7edc682e0e435"},"guid":"7834babb-d757-4aab-a301-c9457ac3ed90","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-04T20:39:49.401299Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8296910324039186,"count":1327},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/visit#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-chicago/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-chicago"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/visit#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"65fdac21-46a7-4a0a-9a6c-dceb8d57e762","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":26,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.703058,"lon":-86.238959},"entity":{"abbreviation":"ND","alternates":{"ceeb":"1841","ipeds":"152080"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"65fdac21-46a7-4a0a-9a6c-dceb8d57e762","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"NOTRE DAME, IN","name":"University of Notre Dame","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a8b195d6-7904-42fc-a413-ef3192fe1025","gradSchool":"772690ab-6289-4c48-98ed-c5975445c94e","metroArea":"da0be3e0-ed23-4975-8d17-8408d1cf2ac8","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"4a35a616-9dae-4ecf-8877-020351a87daf","zipCode":"96a8e3fb-b767-42aa-99b9-b7cf93c15a7d"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Notre Dame","tagline":["4 Year","NOTRE DAME, IN"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-notre-dame","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.12905051114715757},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":28474},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1450-1550"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"ND is a really unique community, and I think my favorite thing about it was that so many of the students there feel motivated to make a positive contribution through their careers, not just in it for the money. Campus is beautiful and super safe, and there are just a zillion ways to have fun as a student there. As a downside, definitely less diversity than some other schools, but there are a lot of ways to find your people, no matter who you are. Finding your version of ND is important: not everyone loves football, and there's a strong current that will want to sweep you up in that, but going to games is NOT the only thing to do on Saturdays. I went to like 3 games a year, and that was enough for me. Staying grounded, finding your friends, and making sure you take advantage of the academic resources available there would be my tips for success.

Whether it was in the humanities, business, or engineering, I felt like I had access to some of the best faculty in the country. The opportunities for research, even as an undergraduate, were abundant, and I always felt encouraged to explore new ideas and dive deep into my studies.\n\nThe University of Virginia’s campus is absolutely stunning.

Joining multicultural Greek life and research labs were the highlights of my time at USC!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-14T18:51:52.104138Z","guid":"4818bec4-9989-4ab1-8ea3-a1ae7044815d","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ironypoinsoning","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e3bd854a9dfbb906fafca9d0babe6e12074f6528.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1e5242b4dd183d32c3abb589b108432c0a8a1db3.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e3bd854a9dfbb906fafca9d0babe6e12074f6528.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/84bfd782b3771b4374b59edb3f8e823a1d821bc9"},"guid":"b5ec600a-210a-4439-9cc5-d243d31e70eb","licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ironypoisoning/9758137505/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.283858,34.021058,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.283858,34.021058,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5dd097db-2f9e-421a-a4c0-73e5463271b2","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.996382054992764,"count":4146},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-california/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-southern-california"}]},{"guid":"465d4a73-875c-498e-9c8f-e47568e156f2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":29,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.711669,"lon":-73.205888},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Williams","alternates":{"ceeb":"3965","ipeds":"168342"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"465d4a73-875c-498e-9c8f-e47568e156f2","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"WILLIAMSTOWN, MA","name":"Williams College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"bc127919-39f9-4b11-b6e0-eb34203166df","gradSchool":"8b907a70-d0e9-4c23-9621-20f696795415","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"e7f5b0e6-8069-4e27-b2c5-1f683ec00363","zipCode":"2dded6ad-aaea-42b2-b538-adba1178c0a9"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Williams","tagline":["4 Year","WILLIAMSTOWN, MA"],"type":"College","url":"williams-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.08488278092158448},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20965},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1480-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Williams College is often considered one of the best schools because of its incredible sense of community.

I'm a current first year, and I could not be happier with my decision to apply early and come here. When I talk to my friends from high school, almost no one is having as good of a college experience as the people I know at Bowdoin. Bowdoin CARES about your quality of life, and that's not true everywhere, while maintaining excellent academics. The housing is fantastic and the food is amazing (we have lobster bake at the start of every year and they have special meals for every holiday). I'm honestly excited for every meal! The college house system (where many sophomores live) host fun events every weekend, and so although we don't have greek life, there are always parties to attend if that's your thing (no worries if not!

I truly did not realize how enormous the university was! Being an undergraduate, most of my courses were on main campus. Yet there the UNC Hospital, The Dean Dome (Basketball stadium), Kenan Stadium( Football field), etc. I had some really great professors and teaching assistants! Especially in my Psychology course work! I loved my Communication courses as well! Awesome Professors from Ivy League colleges! I think the main things that I would have changed at the time was the manner in which roommates were assigned. They had a lottery system that did not account for personal preferences. There was some recognizable diversity but most of it was student lead, not university lead. They have improved. All in all, I would not change my undergrad experience for anything in the world!

The very best people and professors, all thriving in a charming town located right outside of Charlotte. As an alum and current parent, it's difficult to put into words how much the Davidson experience means to me. Davidson had a HUGE impact on my life and I thank my lucky stars that my child is fortunate enough to share in the experience. The \"vibe\" on campus is one of joy, curiosity and kindness -- where serious intellectual pursuits coexist with countless opportunities for fun (think sporting events, student-run events/performances and fun parties). Locationally, the campus benefits from its Southern charm (ie, Davidson's friendly Main Street & nice weather), while striving to provide a supportive environment for students from all backgrounds. According to my current student, it often feels like a little \"utopia\" where many perspectives can live happily together. I made friends for life at Davidson and thankfully, my student has done the same.

(Don’t believe the non-sense about the Civil War being relitigated on campus - it’s nonsense.

The only conflicts that were discussed were around which frat to go to first for a party.) It’s a highly competitive (but not cut-throat) culture.

It also has a number of awesome study abroad programs. This meant I had a great resume when I graduated, which I remain grateful for, and I'm sure has helped me. However! It also meant that, functionally, you're hardly ever on campus at the same time as your friends after the first year and a half. It is a deeply utilitarian school, I think.  Which is fine, and important nowadays. But it just lacks a culture, unless you can call the huge rich international student population a culture, since they all seem to have gone to the same prototype of British accented boarding school . There is also the slightly sinister undercurrent of how insanely mercenary the actual university is in its attempt to make more money, rise in the rankings, and stick a campus in every random city. I had three different advisors over the course in my time there, which didn't make me feel super supported by the uni.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-19T20:15:58.445903Z","guid":"96d6a435-c7d3-4248-ba06-17689cc39147","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ce4c496d122d971e14f0bbe683b79cf9ad914e21","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ad734f469ed2f5db0f95426d6b4078b1fef48a3f","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fc5fd1ec47f50a62a70aa7f0f29c89bb71472d3c","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5cba58e69487f04d7a6d79a4f2d8423fb9e15cc7"},"guid":"03240ff2-696c-42c4-ba65-b28a38c94ea9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-04T18:49:58.077704Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23d07a4f9a7b13f5d32c349b024c08af0d0b1d7e"},"guid":"75453b64-d10e-4d1d-ad86-189e186b9b1f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-26T21:06:22.216746Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"54621696-a116-42a6-80c3-dc6189cc4728","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c4f8cb2a123e86e0fcace3f4fa340dd940e7a86","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ae770a45894ba117174ec1f16f223e3950f61182"},"guid":"6a628d23-79bf-466d-a862-73daf39fd5df","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-04-24T01:04:44.681782Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7584503380135206,"count":3846},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/northeastern"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northeastern-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=northeastern-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/northeastern"}]},{"guid":"09e8cd9a-f401-4c8b-a79c-f02e10ac0201","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":42,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":37.871519,"lon":-122.260401},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Cal","alternates":{"ceeb":"4833","ipeds":"110635"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"09e8cd9a-f401-4c8b-a79c-f02e10ac0201","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"BERKELEY, CA","name":"University of California - Berkeley","parentGUIDs":{"college":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"9b5c7e66-a434-4dcc-ae52-40a6a254e757","gradSchool":"f433cfe4-7829-4404-9244-aabab29d522d","metroArea":"d8ccf170-f072-4180-977c-a91f914ebcfe","neighborhood":"48053996-4a7f-4cea-be66-04c804c9eb3c","parent":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"4eb8fec9-8de0-46a9-b898-75cc913b8cef","zipCode":"0f5b62b6-d781-4b18-ba53-74b267915118"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UC Berkeley","tagline":["4 Year","BERKELEY, CA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-california-berkeley","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.11327597906543223},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19257},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1310-1530"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"UC Berkeley offers a challenging yet rewarding experience. Academically, it’s rigorous, with little hand-holding, but there are plenty of resources like office hours and tutoring if you seek them out. The campus is always buzzing with events, activism, and diverse perspectives, making it an exciting but sometimes overwhelming place. Socially, finding a community takes effort, especially in large lectures, but joining clubs, organizations, or Greek life helps. Housing and food are a mixed bag—dorms vary in quality, and off-campus rent is high. Overall, Berkeley is a fast-paced, intellectually stimulating environment that pushes you to grow, making it ideal for those who thrive under challenge and independence.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-27T22:52:11.874264Z","guid":"41608ed9-32dd-4ced-ac76-86fd9ba16775","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"brainchildvn","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24efb63ec8db2fa0d54fe08a3f6abde1b653ca0a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4934dd73c7ea9fb814c968a09310e7e6e7390734.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24efb63ec8db2fa0d54fe08a3f6abde1b653ca0a.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dcef45b67ada2ca6746821d6e5447311b2d24f95"},"guid":"b25ded2d-9fe2-4189-89a7-55b15a74bc81","licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/brainchildvn/2280342987/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.260401,37.871519,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.260401,37.871519,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"177b37ac-70cb-4c50-a873-179cf9aba112","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.729588504245591,"count":4593},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california-berkeley/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-california-berkeley"}]},{"guid":"6936eab7-0ffa-46c9-b51a-602348276537","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":43,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.337688,"lon":-71.171488},"entity":{"abbreviation":"BC","alternates":{"ceeb":"3083","ipeds":"164924"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6936eab7-0ffa-46c9-b51a-602348276537","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CHESTNUT HILL, MA","name":"Boston College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"30b8db32-3b30-440f-a944-ef23b93121d2","gradSchool":"58bdcbd0-f84a-4b4b-97e5-0b6d4d010f8d","metroArea":"1fb5f13a-6673-4bc7-a0c2-fcb7e56d7831","neighborhood":"c85d6f42-d56a-4f68-bce0-6b055d76cfd2","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"5f2944d1-5cac-4123-a33c-8d68fc8dbaab","zipCode":"f3053f07-d487-4f9a-9d8b-0e5effe7d213"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Boston College","tagline":["4 Year","CHESTNUT HILL, MA"],"type":"College","url":"boston-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.1667823328210975},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":30559},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1430-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I just transferred to Boston College after completing my first year of undergraduate studies at Georgetown University in DC. I'm an adult nontraditional student in my late 30s. Everything about BC has been fantastic. The campus is one of the most beautiful, peaceful places I have ever seen; it reminds me of my time in Rome. The business program, along with its faculty and alumni connections, is second to none. The administration has made my transfer process from Georgetown as smooth as possible. The professors are world-class. The sports atmosphere and school spirit are through the roof, which makes learning here more fun. The Jesuit educational tradition and pedagogy in the BC core curriculum are world-class. They truly go out of their way with scholarship opportunities and affordability so adults like me can come back to college and finish what we started at a prestigious institution. I can't wait to graduate and be a Boston College Eagle for life.

As for the party scene, there is some at Wellesley and their societies but usually students will go to Boston on the shuttle on the weekends. A small college means more oppurtunities for first years to get leadership oppurtunities and being at a womens college is inspiring and empowering. Our alumnae network is very strong and every body here is smart, friendly, and have good morals.

I have absolutely loved my time at Wake Forest so far. There truly is something for everyone here and the resources available to us students is something you won’t get at bigger universities. Although the workload is intense at times, we still have plenty of time to party. Greek Life is a very big part of the social scene here, but there are 18+ bars downtown and being in Greek Life is not an essential whatsoever. All the professors here truly care about us students, and we get to know them well as class sizes are very small. They are great teachers and very understanding.

It's definitely not like being in a city, but friends and I had fun going apple picking, strawberry picking, and visiting the Yankee Candle Factory.

All courses I've take on campus have a strong focus on real-world applications. This aspect helps make the curriculum more engaging. The campus has plenty of opportunities to gain hands-on experience through internships, career fairs, and networking events. There are numerous resources on campus to ensure a student is successful both during they're time on campus and after graduation. The campus is very vibrant, offering a diverse community and many RSO's that make it easy to get involved. However, there are some areas where the university could improve. At times, academic advising can be a hit or miss in terms of providing clear guidance. In addition, some courses on campus feel outdated and could benefit from more relevant content, which the university has slowly tried implementing.

I did't know any coming into college, as majority of my friends had stayed up North, therefore, I was homesick and lonely quite often. I was fortunate enough to have gotten an amazing roommate which eased the transition process. This all changed during the Spring semester as I began to put myself out there and joined several different clubs (I really recommend this). After the rough adjustment time, I started to really enjoy my time at Florida State University. The campus is beautiful, the people are friendly, the school spirit is exceptional, there are so many different clubs and sororities that you can become a part of, and Tallahassee isn't too bad. I do recommend, however, bringing your car on campus so you can travel to the beaches with your friends on the weekend!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-23T16:01:43.3214Z","guid":"6600bacd-2c56-41c5-a6bb-b3ae6f09edca","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d25f4b0ccbcde5409ca69005f4e187b0c6def62e","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/83f8b28b430c1871666cf454d54521893326767e","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/12f221befdfda4231aa5b501a5b534ce395bfa64","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4632107fcfe5e25916a12cca1437b19aa080cd14"},"guid":"9369dfea-214a-4eeb-bfa3-9bbb613c2344","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-25T15:01:42.533132Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.294801,30.4421,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.294801,30.4421,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"450af3f5-1088-4b78-a31e-68bf6681ecdd","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9860423232778026,"count":8884},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://app.adoraexperiences.com/florida-state-university/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=florida-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://app.adoraexperiences.com/florida-state-university/"}]},{"guid":"b7c5c6c9-6a6f-4a1f-b098-c71ddd41de83","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":52,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.956428,"lon":-83.374049},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UGA","alternates":{"ceeb":"5813","ipeds":"139959"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b7c5c6c9-6a6f-4a1f-b098-c71ddd41de83","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"ATHENS, GA","name":"University of Georgia","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ddc1254f-642f-480d-9b33-73fa51fe07f7","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"717fd239-1da0-4da2-8c39-ceb05e001028","gradSchool":"368d6699-d3e9-4a1e-8c49-87ca8ca8ccce","metroArea":"6ba3a9da-efb3-4e3a-9840-c3b48c3c3a78","parent":"ddc1254f-642f-480d-9b33-73fa51fe07f7","state":"2db170c0-259a-4537-ae3e-920d51841b7e","town":"fe4403de-abaf-4abd-83b1-53a15cd3af84","zipCode":"ff06c2a5-0d7f-41d9-a000-3ad9cecc0df3"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Georgia","tagline":["4 Year","ATHENS, GA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-georgia","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.42546749777382015},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17180},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1220-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have loved my experience at the University of Georgia so far!

The support provided by programs like the Dream Center was invaluable, offering resources that made me feel seen and supported as an undocumented student. However, I believe there is room for growth in expanding opportunities for undocumented students, particularly in areas like work-study. Allowing access to work-study positions would open doors for financial stability and professional growth, ensuring these students have equitable opportunities to succeed. Increased funding for scholarships and mentorship programs tailored to undocumented students would also be impactful. By addressing these areas, UC Irvine could further its mission of empowering all students to achieve their full potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-20T19:44:30.403516Z","guid":"9cc6d022-eac3-4cb4-98e8-cf78ecd96f48","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8be0363ebadb810eae409e6378fbbee607c86e2b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50f05dfd9b189f36bd413cebb6697985b9de3fed","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9161ab41d2cf1d11a4aa27f1e41c90ca567a9b24","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f0cb26c3bee1e58fb0b5d51164a6beef48a6a96e"},"guid":"d9962774-5208-44b6-bec1-1e236cd5c905","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-06T21:55:33.911483Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.841248,33.648434,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.841248,33.648434,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"0b2e79e6-3a54-42ea-8ca7-cbfce70267e1","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.783802333562114,"count":4371},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.uci.edu/virtualtour?utm_source=niche"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california-irvine/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-california-irvine"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.uci.edu/virtualtour?utm_source=niche"}]},{"guid":"fed9be26-518d-4a71-ba22-cd4ad1066ffb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":56,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.073858,"lon":-89.405356},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Wisconsin","alternates":{"ceeb":"1846","ipeds":"240444"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"fed9be26-518d-4a71-ba22-cd4ad1066ffb","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"MADISON, WI","name":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","parentGUIDs":{"college":"234e8e67-b92f-443a-bcf4-43e2d55517dd","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"4135e47a-62f6-4777-b514-d2e51894603f","gradSchool":"aff0993c-0395-491b-a4cf-d7a343e006b3","metroArea":"1a1aaa73-65d0-490d-b3d3-d828716c5f6b","parent":"234e8e67-b92f-443a-bcf4-43e2d55517dd","state":"963a1085-efe7-45f5-81ee-d2bbf82a907c","town":"05edf34e-5095-459f-a9c1-81805b398fed","zipCode":"c4b28f5d-1ff3-4f9a-bc4a-a3a706370fd4"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Wisconsin","tagline":["4 Year","MADISON, WI"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-wisconsin-madison","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.490566977779254},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13376},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1340-1510"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Overall, my experience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has been amazing.

Aggie Spirit provides a welcoming environment where students support one another, hence a strong sense of belonging. The university's engineering programs, including nuclear engineering, are well ranked, with practical exposure, research, and exposure to field experts. The campus is lively with many student organizations and leadership programs. Though, class sizes are big in a few of the introductory courses, and it is hard to get individual attention. More investment in the small class sections and other academic assistance would be a game-changer. Overall, Texas A&M has a good career development foundation with leadership and service values ingrained.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-10T03:29:50.994484Z","guid":"9abfdc74-5966-46a4-9638-197fdb5c1c64","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"stuseeger","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a0f7410db335a9443c0934f26d377bf2d3ba629b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7e5df561ff9968d60c6f5022c680192ef636286","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fa271ea07abfddc731079ce9793da308e537bd83","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb492e6a8a72e97d64e868b28c768f91975ce874"},"guid":"fb21f194-bfe2-4857-8d05-9f07b6d46ff2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuseeger/1236808146/","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-26T17:11:52.622643Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3176e9f6363f401c24a06d1c85e0be44b0b1b010"},"guid":"07cde548-dc00-49d5-9e60-069705ffda48","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-05T16:46:25.143444Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"fb96e925-52bb-4274-85d9-a1b825b659b2","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.078285643503035,"count":8073},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/isjpvf22T/stop/1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=texas-a-and-m-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/isjpvf22T/stop/1"}]},{"guid":"4caa6248-6cbc-40bf-af3a-42650b42a8e9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":59,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.0364013,"lon":-75.3426064},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Villanova","alternates":{"ceeb":"2959","ipeds":"216597"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"4caa6248-6cbc-40bf-af3a-42650b42a8e9","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"VILLANOVA, PA","name":"Villanova University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"45769fc4-af63-4502-87bf-39c820d00885","gradSchool":"97c31838-19e8-4630-b81f-da7d5fd4b9c5","metroArea":"dbdec0e2-fa77-4d1e-9fa2-346eec4a8132","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"20f4f3b3-5409-49e0-8a10-3b8170f31453","zipCode":"13dc5148-2a68-4e8a-bff1-a25e2095b531"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Villanova","tagline":["4 Year","VILLANOVA, PA"],"type":"College","url":"villanova-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.23395149786019973},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":34837},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1360-1500"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Other","body":"One thing I enjoyed was how easy it was to become involved in student life, i.e. interest clubs, volunteering, intramural sports, etc. I was able to be involved in a wide variety of my interests but at a very casual level (you didn't have to apply/be accepted to everything or compete with others for a spot).

However, I’d like to see more opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly between engineering and other fields. Additionally, more resources for mental health and stress management would be helpful, as the academic pressure can sometimes be overwhelming.

I really love the campus life, the layout of the city and campus, and the amount of trees all over. A slight problem is the city is starting to look very gentrified and high income which is a problem for the students. Also, the school allows in way too many students, making it difficult to find bike parking sometimes, get enrollment in a class you want, and sometimes classes are booked with more people than seats available. Overall, it’s a great school with well-known, intelligent professors, but it is starting to feel like a separation between the city and the campus. A lot of the residents don’t like students and outcast us, as if we aren’t just trying to make a name for ourselves.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-10T07:44:35.515695Z","guid":"3e628c62-fc22-4277-87c5-b9922f01ad11","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"goodlifegarden","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a9451ceb72fd3fdb170c68889158ca606d63e9d0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f33743c4529cb9d4fb5b9776804766be3cb9aad1.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a9451ceb72fd3fdb170c68889158ca606d63e9d0.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/90badfa5388c886987a1288f51d145e9cbf334e0"},"guid":"dc78ccce-5875-40ab-b184-5d27a0377505","licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/goodlifegarden/16186307068/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.751958,38.539895,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.751958,38.539895,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"0917f150-e146-4db3-96fb-a635a06a1edb","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9150156412930137,"count":5754},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.ucdavis.edu/about/visit/campus-virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california-davis/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-california-davis"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.ucdavis.edu/about/visit/campus-virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"e4b6f153-8cd9-4ff7-ad49-c2352d47e5e6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":64,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.876598,"lon":-117.237793},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UCSD","alternates":{"ceeb":"4836","ipeds":"110680"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e4b6f153-8cd9-4ff7-ad49-c2352d47e5e6","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"LA JOLLA, CA","name":"University of California - San Diego","parentGUIDs":{"college":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"cd82b2c8-1208-47a0-858d-e67d10999c33","gradSchool":"5cb44f62-7612-4e43-9347-dbd3700bb22b","metroArea":"71a6a53b-23da-4ec2-b564-ffc13563d4ad","neighborhood":"3df0ede6-efe8-46af-b35f-f71a8fe57af9","parent":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"6d9c7b93-552e-4f06-962e-afc9831390d4","zipCode":"9414c340-5f5a-4609-83f7-bddc5ce80124"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UC San Diego","tagline":["4 Year","LA JOLLA, CA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-california-san-diego","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.2370709696105856},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":16111},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"So far in my one year in the university, I have deeply enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere from the college community as a whole. No one seems to question where you are from or how you got to this specific school, they just accept you for who you are and that has facilitated my learning and social experience immensely. UCSD academics are ranked as some of the best in the nation, with amazing research opportunities and plenty of resources to get your career started. Housing and dining services are way better than I expected, and the commute across campus is very scenic and safe overall. One thing I would change about my experience would be a more flexible process for class and room selection, as well as a reduced overall price for tuition since many charges are non-student related.

It’s inspiring to engage with peers who bring unique viewpoints to class discussions and extracurricular activities. USF has a vibrant environment where diversity is not just accepted but actively encouraged, creating a dynamic space for learning and growth. Academically, I’ve found the programs and resources offered at USF to be supportive. As a student in the Muma College of Business, I’ve had access to top-notch professors who are not only experts in their fields but also genuinely invested in students’ success. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical applications, such as internships and networking events, has been invaluable in preparing me for my career goals. The faculty's dedication to fostering a nurturing educational experience stands out as one of USF’s strongest points.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-21T05:11:32.958689Z","guid":"9ac61663-448d-404b-9d23-8577ad8f3183","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"akellogg","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b665cf492df75eb877a2e8ecb007d5ffd0c6c4f3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f15ed742bf429487326748c607db9decad1352e.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b665cf492df75eb877a2e8ecb007d5ffd0c6c4f3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/067674f99d0e50b9de1872e8e1243e97923deae7"},"guid":"2e893fe0-d303-42a5-9960-3c0cdeeb4b50","licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/akellogg/109725514/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.415876,28.056647,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.415876,28.056647,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"406c2a14-fde9-468a-9817-e53d804940c7","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.830462375339982,"count":7721},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/usf/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-florida/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-south-florida"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/usf/"}]},{"guid":"fbf152a7-a7f6-4afb-9fd7-143864f74928","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":69,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":29.939696,"lon":-90.120409},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Tulane","alternates":{"ceeb":"6832","ipeds":"160755"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"fbf152a7-a7f6-4afb-9fd7-143864f74928","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEW ORLEANS, LA","name":"Tulane University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5e6789a-dd16-4f72-97c1-21f3f4667cee","gradSchool":"87df3ccc-dd33-4e67-9772-2e72ee7eadb0","metroArea":"321e841c-3105-4314-9bcb-c11cd5cac8e9","neighborhood":"b90e8555-634b-4815-8875-4c94562d72f2","state":"0a52f9a9-fad5-4324-8731-e46e1f299b3a","town":"9ec4683a-c6a7-414b-91ce-7075763eadfa","zipCode":"22db0f5c-a487-48e9-938f-70b283e691be"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Tulane","tagline":["4 Year","NEW ORLEANS, LA"],"type":"College","url":"tulane-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.11453424007591333},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":50263},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1370-1510"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"By FAR the best college in the United States. I mean it. This school is nothing but perfect. Any complaints that I have made have been solely due to personal mistakes or attitudes. There is a crowd for anyone at Tulane. A major for anyone. There are so many outlets for support. The food is phenomenal I don't care what people say: I'm talking poke, sushi, tacos, burritos, taco bowls, dunkin, salad bowls, pizza, chicken tenders, burgers, smoothies, smoothie bowls, all types of toasts, sandwiches, soups, pasta, lattes, snacks, chips, I am probably missing something. I played sports my whole life, and I was upset when Tulane didn't have my sports. So I changed my attitude and I joined a new sport for the first time and I love it!! Academics are challenging if you want them to be. I am pre-med and it certainly teaches you balancing skills. Mardi Gras is so fun. The city is awesome. This school is just perfect I promise please go here. It's warm too.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-08T03:13:08.563468Z","guid":"1e057042-d3f3-473b-87d0-0010a9943415","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"suecline","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c9c253b7c97c9a1009cdd70a4a432b7aaabbf756","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5f2d36c7fcfb8b58590d04c2736057f0067e2828","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3e45b5c6e8e227a09ef2535db90479aeb6c25c0a","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/17ea6167527ab401980fd14827b65c828b8a8f06"},"guid":"c9f8e3ff-3960-4a99-b4b4-8861ac1fdb44","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/suecline/2354987089/","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-21T15:24:33.820435Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/873d46da2c85f2b4c5139a25c0fc5898e78b7db8"},"guid":"dc8f6cce-be3c-474b-9867-390be1b92f96","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-05-09T14:49:38.269988Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.120409,29.939696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.120409,29.939696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"705da025-a10a-46d0-8e12-fa458b9e624c","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/561c35774f34a368f9ca1b8cec006bdaf4ae3616","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a2731510a39b0ba0ea3ba360f9f5ddb342365b5"},"guid":"680717cf-7b23-479a-9876-136d4ee7a30c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-03-22T19:00:29.786292Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.77211482132396,"count":1707},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admission.tulane.edu/virtual-visiting"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tulane-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=tulane-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admission.tulane.edu/virtual-visiting"}]},{"guid":"0055c0af-444e-46b0-a9a0-857a5e30966b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":70,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.8188,"lon":-75.535},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Colgate","alternates":{"ceeb":"2086","ipeds":"190099"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"0055c0af-444e-46b0-a9a0-857a5e30966b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"HAMILTON, NY","name":"Colgate University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"1159172a-f1ec-45ac-aefa-84643fb935e1","gradSchool":"d6f3b0a1-0685-42d1-bfa2-5afb9a7fd22d","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"57f5f955-bbb3-40b4-92ab-127490f7862c","zipCode":"bb96ef4c-e310-447d-8d4b-2912cbfb1f8d"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Colgate","tagline":["4 Year","HAMILTON, NY"],"type":"College","url":"colgate-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.12430716755886115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":27074},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1410-1530"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have found Colgate to thus far be a welcoming community, committed to fostering a diverse, safe space to promote student growth.

Although it is not a majority of the school that is associated with Greek Life it often feels like a large part of the campus life and therefore interested students should be aware of that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-23T20:13:44.506251Z","guid":"2e3f66b9-9e40-4aaa-bdce-f8812386b11d","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/162ed23aab416a7c75bcf5c96502dd4b07a8b6b4","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b4f614497ad3c0152151309deef25b81efad7b17","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ffd61ff90d709dfbd6a0a09315c2d91c31997699","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a8555d27b3b74851ac61fed9b303df93ccbbe662"},"guid":"8ff761b4-72b5-4ea1-b8ab-b0fcc03a2ce5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-15T16:04:14.147892Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f8de304a7741899689cf5153616bf21022441f0"},"guid":"a6562136-9402-4ee9-8e85-1e5e0cac2b27","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T20:37:42.014598Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.5407146,37.5751669,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.5407146,37.5751669,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"778ccfbe-3a63-4f8e-8e02-a482b10109d9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8fdb7c3b0d7fc3ca8f59e85172eff79a4c1d0729","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/59fd48474f41fbb6caaca9c69946b9441e44d8af"},"guid":"68f80d7c-34f9-413d-b73f-86b560a250d5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-15T15:32:54.745735Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8895939086294415,"count":788},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.richmond.edu/#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-richmond/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-richmond"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.richmond.edu/#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"6fb0ee68-051c-4fb6-b0b5-6419be89d63e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":73,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.296529,"lon":-71.269479},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Babson","alternates":{"ceeb":"3075","ipeds":"164580"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6fb0ee68-051c-4fb6-b0b5-6419be89d63e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WELLESLEY, MA","name":"Babson College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"26004d20-2d9c-4b07-82c2-1b69fd6a97d7","gradSchool":"a384b167-e9a1-4050-ba6e-483db2df72d5","metroArea":"1fb5f13a-6673-4bc7-a0c2-fcb7e56d7831","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"f58e470b-50ae-4617-b108-db23d28b9464","zipCode":"05a936ba-4809-4ce9-89e4-bec9e2b9e23b"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Babson","tagline":["4 Year","WELLESLEY, MA"],"type":"College","url":"babson-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.22347837518075456},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":28400},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1350-1510"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Personally, I believe that Babson College offers a strong academic environment with excellent professors and strong diversity representing many different countries, making it a great place for international entrepreneurial learning.

School spirit’s good in my opinion. Football games are crazy and there’s a ton of extracirriculars to get involved in if you know where to look. There’s also a lot of active bars nearby if you’re into that, I’m not personally but it’s an option.\nPeople on this subreddit complain that they can’t make many friends in class, but if you’re proactive in class groupchats and plan study sessions you can always make friends in class. It’s also really easy to make friends through extracirriculars. You kind of just have to seek out friendships to make them.\nCampus is big which can be difficult sometimes when you’re trying to get from one side of campus to the other (although I’m at Rosen so I’m not dealing with that most of the time). I also thinks it gives the campus more character. Very lively except for Sundays (very typical for all college campuses).After all, love my professors for the spring semester!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-11T17:56:08.284481Z","guid":"8848080b-cb7b-4c01-98e3-5765c8b0a10f","helpfulness":2,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ucfblog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca592e3988773107868625cb52360dd817f49cbf.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c9923b9bf52c08d3e5bfc321d300e65797240a59.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca592e3988773107868625cb52360dd817f49cbf.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e70139314570d477f12540df95a6df7f128fbdf"},"guid":"03367c60-6ad3-4f9b-9e88-856e3556643a","licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucfblog/4698157590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.198805,28.60106,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.198805,28.60106,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"77de661c-b90c-47f0-bb3d-6717c2a98a61","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.829864493844655,"count":22582},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-central-florida/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-central-florida"}]},{"guid":"7c5933a0-8dd6-4313-89cf-c9a3f41b7d3b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":78,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.500812,"lon":-81.605769},"entity":{"abbreviation":"CWRU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1105","ipeds":"201645"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7c5933a0-8dd6-4313-89cf-c9a3f41b7d3b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CLEVELAND, OH","name":"Case Western Reserve University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2c4f8206-f7b9-47f2-a930-da7d20a1aa9a","gradSchool":"f4ed9a55-83ef-4125-b4b5-105e8b959955","metroArea":"abd7b42e-3fe4-4969-a9bb-3530a7fe775e","neighborhood":"d2ca2e0c-bb51-48ed-93c4-d419a8a176d7","state":"e22ca9b6-60b3-461e-b905-42a3e83cbeb2","town":"ae4413e9-cc9f-4257-9459-989d096476f0","zipCode":"35c3f597-8baa-4767-b269-e77fa67297d5"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Case Western Reserve","tagline":["4 Year","CLEVELAND, OH"],"type":"College","url":"case-western-reserve-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.27407560528151725},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":38279},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1410-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Case Western's online courses offer a flexible and intense learning environment that can initially feel overwhelming. The structure and expectations might seem daunting at first, especially when managing coursework, deadlines, and discussions from a distance. However, a key strategy for success is to review the syllabus thoroughly before each class to understand the schedule, assignments, and major topics. By staying ahead and staying organized, the material will begin to make sense, and you'll feel more in control of your learning.

The bar was set high in many courses, and I left with the knowledge that I needed after graduation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-11T01:29:54.894373Z","guid":"385804b4-571a-4cc5-802c-4acec31808ce","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b4f5b668bdc4ce03f6e5f694505057b2f6c22038","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a8d16de3c8df49dd468d05f06ec7a4c384191cc","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbfc91fdf9a95786a3cbe2c223994fdff37181d8","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a1bf627eade47ed85c6c62db406414b3c25e3e60"},"guid":"15441e91-6171-4765-a613-b0744f32b1cc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-17T19:14:49.479153Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7766e588379daa5b3b50266a79f0dc2db3585464"},"guid":"e49ef1c7-3f94-459f-a1d0-f054eca42672","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-18T19:13:11.24944Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.482577,29.46286,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.482577,29.46286,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"fe688ef9-580d-4e9a-b14f-398412978f0d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/57f2e48dbd85744b6e1abb78efc65185a58ec26e","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fea281b7f7e6fc5ba534cdc59a6fa7f609e6adf"},"guid":"d6a95291-21fe-433d-a08a-ca228646c5da","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-18T19:50:25.229051Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.724543080939948,"count":766},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tour.concept3d.com/en/share/AvEaHIKBpy/stop/1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=trinity-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tour.concept3d.com/en/share/AvEaHIKBpy/stop/1"}]},{"guid":"6546bf51-e026-4a43-ba7f-79f02126e09c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":80,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.998389,"lon":-83.009001},"entity":{"abbreviation":"OSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1592","ipeds":"204796"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6546bf51-e026-4a43-ba7f-79f02126e09c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"COLUMBUS, OH","name":"The Ohio State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"8451ca9e-c218-469c-93ce-3113b65ed4aa","gradSchool":"14a91092-88f6-4db4-b159-59d9cdfd79f7","metroArea":"4708dde2-2554-43ee-9f06-fc5221e471e7","neighborhood":"53f27bf0-f247-4ec1-a00f-0419c5b26d6b","state":"e22ca9b6-60b3-461e-b905-42a3e83cbeb2","town":"0fb7638b-be35-4fc8-94b8-9ef56ef26cdb","zipCode":"97a576bc-662d-4df7-abd3-3d4304b0acad"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Ohio State","tagline":["4 Year","COLUMBUS, OH"],"type":"College","url":"the-ohio-state-university","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5272361901547807},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19582},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1310-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The Ohio State University was a great school for me for several reasons. For one, the professors for the psychology program are (with few exceptions) amazing and extremely caring. Outside of academics, the student involvement and diversity was amazing and promoted a great sense of inclusion. However, now I understand that the Center for Belonging and Social Change is being sunset, so likely the amazing atmosphere I experienced will change... I would definitely keep that in mind, especially for first generation and minority students: this university is absolutely abandoning its values.  The dorm experience also is, as many students have mentioned, pretty dreadful depending on the hall you get assigned to.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-02T02:20:39.560335Z","guid":"f4f020d2-8a37-419b-80d3-73ada608bbec","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bff9e9ff233bf48aee70041a4d2333184c214fb0","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0259f35d33cc83edfa5142b23da4a1e2b1052a28","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/486e12983fc15ad984988c2f175db81735c15d0b","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0517a9eb9534bd4261e04f5e22a1d7721e35420c"},"guid":"580bfeb3-746d-4570-816f-d1ed9650d3c8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-01T18:01:41.406826Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d348f26a6149cc7fa493d35015cd6fd4b1ab13a7"},"guid":"d713d685-430b-431e-b87b-1dd812fa0667","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:17:44.319392Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.009001,39.998389,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.009001,39.998389,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"4fad0548-1b61-40cb-bbec-3b83b717cc23","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bd42c75d0e368437b35aaf382a4cb41e9735ffb2","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bd42c75d0e368437b35aaf382a4cb41e9735ffb2"},"guid":"1b7ecf3e-aafd-4033-aa0a-8e91e7ce2e32","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9339966832504145,"count":6030},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://osu.edu/#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-ohio-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=the-ohio-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://osu.edu/#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"79f8ae06-8878-4e4e-87de-0301f452173a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":81,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.988607,"lon":-76.939704},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UMCP","alternates":{"ceeb":"5814","ipeds":"163286"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"79f8ae06-8878-4e4e-87de-0301f452173a","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"COLLEGE PARK, MD","name":"University of Maryland - College Park","parentGUIDs":{"college":"7e5be34d-4791-43dd-9ee6-7826849edd76","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6eeb5d26-dca5-4cff-90bb-199d4f509993","gradSchool":"8fe20919-1797-4692-9535-cef678a1f573","metroArea":"1cd9901c-6cda-4d97-a26e-e3b24e3f25cb","parent":"7e5be34d-4791-43dd-9ee6-7826849edd76","state":"695ce602-38b9-45be-95e7-6646da7cffd8","town":"62fa6c4a-c30d-49a5-8419-0653658e7d51","zipCode":"02deac4d-8613-4ac7-ace4-531bd0a9ec52"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Maryland","tagline":["4 Year","COLLEGE PARK, MD"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-maryland-college-park","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.4460809358538433},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":16210},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1360-1520"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love being a Terp! I transferred my Sophomore year to UMD for the large campus culture and rigorous academic programs the institution offers. We have excellent nationally top ranked programs, including the business school where I intended to apply.  Academics are rigorous and challenging and many programs are \"Limited Enrollment\", meaning you must either be accepted out of high school, or apply once enrolled after meeting gateway course requirements. Campus life is great! There are 700+ student organizations and BIG 10 sporting events. We have several campus dining halls and food is good quality, great selection, and accommodations to meet all needs. There are several restaurant options off campus within walking distance. Housing consists of dorms (some older dorms lack A/C), on campus suites and apartments, and many close off-campus housing options. Transportation consist of campus buses, bike and scooter rentals, and soon a DC Metro Rail stop on campus.

Most notably, the quality of teaching stood out the most for me because (most) professors sought out unique methods of assessment that I felt enhanced my ability to learn and engage with material. Second, the student culture here is really down to Earth. There is wealth here but I feel like it was not overwhelming to adjust to as a low income minority. The school is kind of diverse but the black student population is very very small. Party scene is okay until the winter, then it’s bad (more small intimate stuff). Tons of students get research opportunities through the school and/or neighboring UMN so don’t let research access be a turn off. Food is terrible. Study abroad opportunities are definitely a stand out!! The school also is great at giving resources to students, they really do care. It’s not perfect but I’m glad I went.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-07-18T20:53:56.16242Z","guid":"db3cabec-e694-4ddd-8e0b-e0546b65cfaf","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b01c18678a6a5c4e80860c5bec871b0fb2b1f1b3","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/624ff3e2fb6141b23bedaf4be9c68cb0ab200828","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2d96c1523e698724599a257c51bc09bf75456aa","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b49c371d34872b00d57bf2311861127c5bb81ea2"},"guid":"06f666ad-f86e-41ea-a619-be5a5b1c5abd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-28T13:04:21.129524Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ebdd13ae199270bea5579054c516d7bc79defe5"},"guid":"2c13c7d0-2ab5-4c71-ae44-bd900e12639e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:10:17.90987Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.169855,44.936709,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.169855,44.936709,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e260b358-f5b3-415e-8c3b-11f9bce5a230","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c527db75e6415a99cb0f1e5fe4d76785f6c6f9b7","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c527db75e6415a99cb0f1e5fe4d76785f6c6f9b7"},"guid":"09814d29-f78b-45d6-bab2-1c5b112e0f5a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.811203319502075,"count":482},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://macalester.college-tour.com/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/macalester-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=macalester-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://macalester.college-tour.com/"}]},{"guid":"b1b6ff67-4938-4b0c-9645-8ae03caeb22f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":83,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.8449511,"lon":-96.7859334},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SMU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6660","ipeds":"228246"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b1b6ff67-4938-4b0c-9645-8ae03caeb22f","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"DALLAS, TX","name":"Southern Methodist University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a2ab1556-ac00-46a0-ac94-e9dfedc9331a","gradSchool":"217d5512-d108-4e61-9486-c33c719e2a5e","metroArea":"57178ed6-801f-4b4f-913e-135f42c4afe3","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"c72c3547-0159-4810-b11a-c67da84ff3c8","zipCode":"384b1886-9df9-47dd-bfca-31c3a9b636e5"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Southern Methodist","tagline":["4 Year","DALLAS, TX"],"type":"College","url":"southern-methodist-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5225386996904025},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":45094},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1370-1510"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I couldn’t recommend SMU to anyone more!

The opportunities and support available on campus are unmatched, whether it’s through the counseling services, free tutoring, study spots or scholars programs, there’s a way for every student to succeed. The dorms are old so you get what you get but the community within them is unmatched, from weekly breakfasts and treats on Sundays nights.

Academically, I could not imagine a better experience; all of the professors are awesome and genuinely want you to succeed/will go out of their way to help you. People are generally pretty friendly and go out of their way to help if you are stuck on any assignments or anything. Food has gotten a LOT better every year I've been here. Housing is pretty bad for underclassmen and good for upperclassmen, but they seem to be putting effort into improving it, though that hasn't really happened yet. The campus is unbelievably beautiful and people try to spend as much time as possible outdoors- whether that's chilling on the lawn or skiing. Admin is also great and listens to what people actually want. Overall, awesome people - students, faculty, staff, and admin are all really great. My biggest complaints are that social life can get boring and that campus is pretty isolated, but you learn to deal with both of these.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-10T01:10:59.401201Z","guid":"54fef9af-ca73-43b8-8486-04d8a98ebafd","helpfulness":4,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15da84d1ed3ad6d489144684ac6671c1185f4caa","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d928f75c83d707f7f302aaab10a351478020daa","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15da84d1ed3ad6d489144684ac6671c1185f4caa","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/541f37760651972a4bb364351a1f785532a4aa37"},"guid":"84d1d922-7dfa-4fcb-85cb-a5ccfb39f96c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b38db18b89cd303972e1a5fdd53ed66641cfdf4b"},"guid":"73633cdd-549e-45a5-994a-08d293796204","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:16:18.661671Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.6616,44.563,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.6616,44.563,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"025b8e15-2c2b-453a-8e52-3a4c137fecc6","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4cdf0c6bf8a8729dcb6095c0d4bb49f5eb355601","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4cdf0c6bf8a8729dcb6095c0d4bb49f5eb355601"},"guid":"4836c3b7-8d31-4335-a452-c39ec82f9186","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.891970802919708,"count":685},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colby-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=colby-college"}]},{"guid":"d4afc202-a90c-4cb9-9c9f-f7d0e9db2743","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":85,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.600201,"lon":-85.492409},"entity":{"abbreviation":"AU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1005","ipeds":"100858"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d4afc202-a90c-4cb9-9c9f-f7d0e9db2743","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"AUBURN, AL","name":"Auburn University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"71f661c3-f843-4753-aea2-d29c03f3bd25","gradSchool":"a7a1c521-cedd-47cd-8e5c-5f52868cc887","state":"bcace3a7-dc8b-437b-a107-4499869a449a","town":"67828955-c504-417c-a914-936c52d675dd","zipCode":"fc647e0c-216a-4e01-8611-c9081de99a75"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Auburn","tagline":["4 Year","AUBURN, AL"],"type":"College","url":"auburn-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.43744118355109096},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":25271},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1220-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Auburn has given me everything and more. As a student from Texas, having no one at the beginning of my freshman year, to a senior graduating in 3 years, I never expected to grow so much while being here. In my opinion, Auburn is nothing short of amazing! I love the campus-wide involvement and how much everyone truly does love Auburn. If I had to change one thing about Auburn, it would be the lack of diversity. I understand Auburn is based in Alabama, but the majority of the campus is white in a middle to high socioeconomic status. This keeps students enrolled at Auburn from accessing diverse experiences and hearing diverse opinions in class discussion, or even passing by on campus. Diversity is an integral part of society. Without it, empathy is lacking. I think Auburn could do a better job at working to have diverse freshman classes in order to maintain the empathy and understanding that comes with understanding diversity.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T16:58:31.904111Z","guid":"e7523863-d0b3-4378-b2ec-db93e469eef8","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4643de58462b695d8dee047c6003e00493e6eade","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/60cc3656698b1aac6e78faa7cbb838f18d710dff","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7dac69e1b78d3bd2451128f039f2ea0e802996eb","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fa5a0a1b2ab5ebba21d445fa356a02e0d89ef956"},"guid":"731648be-d7f7-4af3-a141-c5bb37819e34","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-01T15:07:11.496456Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7be7bc976da8262bc8715e627a23eac3f13b2645"},"guid":"a6142c7b-b683-4ef2-aa95-bd16ecfe0cfc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:15:28.06207Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.492409,32.600201,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.492409,32.600201,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"4f7518be-fb91-400f-a494-e28b78ec76d3","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.03090096798213,"count":2686},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.auburn.edu/admissions/visit/index.php"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/auburn-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=auburn-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.auburn.edu/admissions/visit/index.php"}]},{"guid":"66d370e2-6bbb-4e64-bff6-d719a0ddb2cb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":86,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.462304,"lon":-93.154662},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Carleton","alternates":{"ceeb":"6081","ipeds":"173258"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"66d370e2-6bbb-4e64-bff6-d719a0ddb2cb","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"NORTHFIELD, MN","name":"Carleton College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"1c0d281b-06a1-4ec6-bad8-2e86bc25ed56","state":"534cd634-543d-4983-89c3-22323ac74f77","town":"003ceba6-a4e8-4680-8fde-f4da0e869bbd","zipCode":"b537d8c9-9896-42bb-a797-a1e773e3e601"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Carleton","tagline":["4 Year","NORTHFIELD, MN"],"type":"College","url":"carleton-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.16625888384014914},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":31494},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1430-1550"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Carleton is academically rigorous and provides challenging but beneficial opportunities for learning. The professors are passionate and committed to teaching and most students are collaborative and passionate about learning. There are many different student orgs and I've been able to find a community I enjoy both in and outside student orgs. The general student body feels fairly homogenous --even though admissions highlights students with various interests, they all tend to be the same \"type\" of person. Carleton runs on a quick pace due to the trimester system but I love it. I'm able to only take 3 classes at a time and be done with classes/finals before we go on winter/spring break. Carleton is a predominantly white institution and that has been difficult for me as a student of color from a very diverse home city. I found my people eventually, but that is one things I would change about Carleton. Northfield is a nice, safe town and there are lots of cool ways to engage with it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-14T04:09:15.914685Z","guid":"ba084372-03cc-4b90-9bec-2f0fbe2a1905","helpfulness":4,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/97c72b2262e5c3b92b5c33770fad1361f49ee3ca","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/37f488c4e4bf1587f93f8804ba37d44b57949f47","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/406c4fa779c7870b7edbbb4c9fe7a1b171c38668","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/90ddef838abbd7d3ca876fe8d652c5916418dec1"},"guid":"b19ad2bf-8ab5-4752-b0cc-4303be9b85ba","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-02T15:25:57.539715Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e32caaa4b7de88275e4cedf9d08b5d2cdaa156a7"},"guid":"071831ea-5651-4f48-abd1-b1f42d010d0c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.154662,44.462304,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.154662,44.462304,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5adb9ca2-1d2b-4dae-befe-8b9bcf89a9f0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4763056b64e5e7b0a32c2e1a77d87517e82470dd","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51f4d8a4c566e7f857f4b79f1f525f8910f0d6b8"},"guid":"3ad792a4-890e-451e-aae1-9bf80fe528ad","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-02T15:33:33.259726Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.888086642599278,"count":554},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youvis.it/oukefz"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/carleton-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=carleton-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youvis.it/oukefz"}]},{"guid":"fa40c81d-f56b-4353-9518-17bb497b877f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":87,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":25.757111,"lon":-80.377591},"entity":{"abbreviation":"FIU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5206","ipeds":"133951"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"fa40c81d-f56b-4353-9518-17bb497b877f","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"MIAMI, FL","name":"Florida International University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a8808ee8-57e0-4f19-89d4-a2fe12e875af","gradSchool":"9b023899-0c19-44d6-8d90-2b2e36faf9cc","metroArea":"05c150aa-2b84-4e19-a6e6-c57045e43d8b","onlineChild":"d9788023-489d-4c38-8ee6-4c6070025b85","parent":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","town":"c3dccfb3-7ba7-42b9-9176-d685481b6159","zipCode":"cbf5746f-d95b-45fa-a293-5c0e61536329"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"FIU","tagline":["4 Year","MIAMI, FL"],"type":"College","url":"florida-international-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6385861730957735},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":9881},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1060-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Attending Florida International University (FIU) has been an incredibly transformative experience for me.

I have made lifelong friends and valuable career connections, found my path in life, and established the kind of person I want to be in life going forward. While there were some issues with food on campus, I was able to find options that worked for what I preferred and have been cooking and preparing food on my own for the past two years (due to expense of a meal plan). I find the campus to be fairly walkable or have transportation to and from Centennial campus for students who have classes on both campuses (which I do not). I like the outside area and places that Hillsborough and downtown Raleigh has to offer, but there is a real issue with housing on campus and in the surrounding local area. It is quite expensive, and on-campus housing is nearly impossible to get after freshman year. I feel fairly safe on campus, although with new construction some areas could be better lit to increase safety.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-21T22:33:11.371486Z","guid":"f6114821-26e4-4ab1-9f1e-6156386f110b","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a9ce7524d35652b2321d2d7938486d327d355280","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8825a6e4e08f6af6f4c2b1cbdbc6765dc6f7736a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e8d1a5b40c7376357668083e96c59c9045607148","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e7c10e663da2fd682e2aaeecd6cbf4fba3f76cf0"},"guid":"fc6602d0-586f-4b87-8094-294b4ef30c44","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-20T20:02:32.778734Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51facd0ad4578846f88b24599480bf0254a23123"},"guid":"15f1a468-451f-4e3d-ad35-7d5a1efb2361","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-29T17:13:09.542291Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.6844345,35.78392,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.6844345,35.78392,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e1cac52c-2f0f-40c6-9a34-92902aa3aae8","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/de4d58307e36590b586e64bf96f3995bd91f820e","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5f09da6edc7917dd3c7f38be25973ef58e066dc8"},"guid":"ad169aa1-1530-4dbf-91e9-6c614a56f057","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-21T16:45:43.809028Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8579529345052452,"count":3527},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://visit.ncsu.edu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-carolina-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=north-carolina-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://visit.ncsu.edu/"}]},{"guid":"72a78a8a-ede3-4cfd-93af-af3597264db5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":89,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.677329,"lon":-82.834463},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Clemson","alternates":{"ceeb":"5111","ipeds":"217882"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"72a78a8a-ede3-4cfd-93af-af3597264db5","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CLEMSON, SC","name":"Clemson University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2ab951c6-886a-4beb-9cca-843730b65629","gradSchool":"d17d5f16-f791-4377-b6fc-a692f44de580","metroArea":"e3ad1b0a-bb02-4b78-8bb8-9e4ea6ea7770","state":"4e14b3cc-29b7-46c8-b531-601bf3625739","zipCode":"3b5f3970-1255-49cb-bfa1-2cc7e1956dbe"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Clemson","tagline":["4 Year","CLEMSON, SC"],"type":"College","url":"clemson-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.4298860150717613},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24577},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1220-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Clemson University is the best college because of its superior academic programs, lively campus life, and strong tradition.

Overall, the University of Pittsburgh is an amazing school to attend and I am so grateful to have a chance to receive my education there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-04T21:45:32.634537Z","guid":"e5cbc844-416f-436a-a768-00f40c46f16f","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbbb91010c2b4932c81ead5244a52c0858be423c","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cc46c065f75c82d68561c3e4ca2e67ed9d95ea1c","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/043985bde7663abfc29b2768750948d2a238e2ef","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d9479d1d12d8e3defca16423a3c123da19e3d097"},"guid":"8dff7dc6-715c-42a5-830e-d9d3b915984a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-21T15:40:49.728152Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f0a8734732a3233f92eb7059a4018e5d2d8354d"},"guid":"2813df91-6514-4b84-a181-f1677196103e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:08:42.118155Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.954692,40.444502,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.954692,40.444502,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"9ed872f0-ebad-4c29-adf4-ad2091cd2682","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/016c5685e105b240d877caa666e38e7a651993e5","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/016c5685e105b240d877caa666e38e7a651993e5"},"guid":"70a784a0-ce1e-4316-8b9c-0913f3a24af8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7593968039612875,"count":4443},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.pitt.edu/360-tours/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=niche&utm_campaign=apply"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-pittsburgh"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.pitt.edu/360-tours/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=niche&utm_campaign=apply"}]},{"guid":"ae6d35c8-9988-4c35-a1a7-5f622ddc38d3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":93,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.166383,"lon":-86.526904},"entity":{"abbreviation":"IU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1324","ipeds":"151351"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"ae6d35c8-9988-4c35-a1a7-5f622ddc38d3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"BLOOMINGTON, IN","name":"Indiana University - Bloomington","parentGUIDs":{"college":"8b4975fe-d2cb-42fb-a8ed-0cca388f666c","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"b2e94343-1204-47d2-a6ea-6867150f2510","gradSchool":"14889ebd-495c-4e20-99ba-05c58166c5c4","parent":"8b4975fe-d2cb-42fb-a8ed-0cca388f666c","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"5bdbe397-1f16-4f6c-b991-e2ec0f021732","zipCode":"19073dd3-4612-4909-b5c5-039721a6fe25"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Indiana University","tagline":["4 Year","BLOOMINGTON, IN"],"type":"College","url":"indiana-university-bloomington","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8241214057507987},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":16234},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1180-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"IU is a wonderful college with a beautiful campus! I've enjoyed all my classes so far! The professors are average I would say but some really do go above and beyond and truly care about their students. The campus is bigger than I initially thought so there will definitely be a lot of walking if you chose to attend, which isn't terrible unless it's winter. Downtown Bloomington is super cute as well. Party scene is fun but the bars can be strict so you really rely on Greek life before you're 21. I'm not in a sorority so I struggled with the party scene freshman and sophomore year. My only complaint is that Greek life is so big here that if you're not in it, sometimes it feels like you are missing out.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-08T22:17:37.787443Z","guid":"654e5819-6fc0-4b2a-8978-52b842643459","helpfulness":5,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ed832221e672a82f4546fe030be2b305daf47c78","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/919f45f9187e7e546562c9b1b6018d736be20354","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/83c601a080dfdca1ae24b6067920249dda42f039","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cb0144578c81f4d6c04a6da343bcc2b5e6cb7f9"},"guid":"c3b9e37b-62d8-48af-95ef-b33660c6c31f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-06T13:58:45.988408Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bbc42e200af58a64f72d7f2ce63dced7d1472ef9"},"guid":"6938182e-0fcf-4a07-99ab-572b52c70a41","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-05-06T20:17:27.439718Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"7faa8ed4-d25e-4757-ae7e-f97d50f5d968","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/845aad9b00ba45e283c49051899f096befc8a3fb","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b5dd08aa063b65c6ce9aeab7f7443bab23e8067"},"guid":"bb17a4d0-65ea-47a8-bd51-a41e8a6cba11","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-01T13:02:58.773933Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.853581943081452,"count":5095},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.indiana.edu/visit/virtual-tour.html"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university-bloomington/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=indiana-university-bloomington"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.indiana.edu/visit/virtual-tour.html"}]},{"guid":"d8a18ac9-0e33-430c-bc78-4e69c5681ff4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":94,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":45.480376,"lon":-122.63064},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Reed","alternates":{"ceeb":"4654","ipeds":"209922"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d8a18ac9-0e33-430c-bc78-4e69c5681ff4","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PORTLAND, OR","name":"Reed College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"373aa912-2a11-481b-a647-5c09c5bb1e96","gradSchool":"bcdce770-9c14-4c5b-b683-5ecfe5f50202","metroArea":"bbed0281-ada4-4dc2-9062-eb63a8a7ba53","neighborhood":"5f6fe709-4fef-42dc-acd9-42162e511c16","state":"bb5bef7b-e5b0-48bd-bb7f-ea89dc2109e9","town":"12ef2269-431e-407b-a25d-17c1c6aa451d","zipCode":"5bb8006b-d7a0-43bb-83fe-d437422afd7f"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Reed","tagline":["4 Year","PORTLAND, OR"],"type":"College","url":"reed-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.3041385948026949},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33106},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1320-1500"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"For me it was the perfect school: I went to college wanting to work hard and study in depth in a few different areas (physics, mathematics, philosophy).

As a Freshman I lived in on-campus housing. This afforded me many opportunities to be involved in campus activities such as dances, concerts, plays, pick-up frisbee games, $1 movies, etc. Being on campus provided easy access to all of these. \nThe setting of campus is beautiful next to the mountains, as well as the campus itself. It is always well maintained and clean and well-lit. I was never concerned for my safety on campus.\nMy remaining years at BYU were also enjoyable. I felt the classes had high expectations and (most) of the professors taught and prepared me for meeting the rigor of the course. I loved that BYU offered NUMEROUS study abroad programs. For various reasons I was not able to participate in them, one being the SARS outbreak in China cancelling my student teaching there. I made life long friends and memories there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T23:58:58.110514Z","guid":"1fcf037f-55c2-457c-ab43-c6f4ebf02b69","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cbd53e373fe6f8a5dc58fa2584253139f4786e04.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6c105ac696c1ef53995496636d3c7e853e2475f0.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cbd53e373fe6f8a5dc58fa2584253139f4786e04.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9cf2902d5faa495838ea7902fa0fe202f9e9baf3"},"guid":"9f0eb062-28c2-487b-bc32-ccce02f443d1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.649281,40.250851,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.649281,40.250851,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"2cbfce03-13f2-4ef4-b8b0-a28115ed6535","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.06651634723788,"count":8870},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/brigham-young-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=brigham-young-university"}]},{"guid":"10591a8d-619b-4c83-8026-cf6efcd12d36","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":96,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.3177887,"lon":-72.635903},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Smith","alternates":{"ceeb":"3762","ipeds":"167835"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"Women's College","guid":"10591a8d-619b-4c83-8026-cf6efcd12d36","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NORTHAMPTON, MA","name":"Smith College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"77fd7edb-bac7-443c-b29b-3ec2d9780f59","gradSchool":"87904ce6-850b-49de-9479-037d7795c376","metroArea":"465544f5-573b-42d5-af3c-9bc367448067","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"315c746a-93f4-4342-af4f-da6334c0a079","zipCode":"3e756823-7c60-4009-acb7-d27544e7263b"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Smith","tagline":["4 Year","NORTHAMPTON, MA"],"type":"College","url":"smith-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.22864217911679735},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":30790},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1370-1520"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Smith's reputation is no joke - the incredible internship offers and connections I've gotten from attending have blown my mind.

Women here are supported in classes in ways I think many students don't understand because they've never attended a co-ed school.\n\nSadly, many students here don't realize these privileges and it feels like a lot of wealthy students are competing in the oppression olympics, trying to pass for disadvantaged.\n\nSmith is not a party school, but lots of students take the (free!) bus to UMass on Friday nights. Student life is good for me (an introvert from the midwest), but I can see someone from the city struggling socially.\n\nWhile Smith offered me incredible aid my first year, they have removed ~$20k from my need-based package (family income didn't change).

Though the campus can feel vast, I appreciate the resources, opportunities, and diversity that UMass offers.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-21T04:47:28.627091Z","guid":"13db7865-9271-475c-bd59-ead3796da7b8","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.52613,42.386105,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.52613,42.386105,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"6cd78080-1bd3-4ccd-8fdd-ed2fd0dfbb6c","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9779134494523256,"count":5569},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youvis.it/SNLNCi"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-massachusetts-amherst/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-massachusetts-amherst"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youvis.it/SNLNCi"}]},{"guid":"e3dffeaa-58fa-41d3-bf56-fe2ea314642c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":100,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.8999317,"lon":-77.0472034},"entity":{"abbreviation":"GW","alternates":{"ceeb":"5246","ipeds":"131469"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e3dffeaa-58fa-41d3-bf56-fe2ea314642c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"WASHINGTON, DC","name":"George Washington University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d73df838-83ae-47ca-82f0-0f68c06ac7c7","gradSchool":"3eb7138d-4c64-4840-8f6d-2038b726468a","metroArea":"1cd9901c-6cda-4d97-a26e-e3b24e3f25cb","neighborhood":"0ce52407-87fb-44f9-b44f-06e2903c652b","state":"d8812b16-d311-48fc-882d-56a7a6f186d4","town":"f88fc330-6f67-485b-b3a0-e2b37c14ca23","zipCode":"46069ca6-8c48-48aa-a831-afb0dbceab49"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"George Washington","tagline":["4 Year","WASHINGTON, DC"],"type":"College","url":"george-washington-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.4897674759774078},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":42723},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1330-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved being in DC while attending George Washington University. The location provided unparalleled access to internships, cultural institutions, and political events that enhanced my education beyond the classroom. The professors were very smart and demonstrated exceptional expertise in their fields. Many had worked in government or prominent organizations, bringing real-world insights to their teaching that made complex concepts more accessible.\nHowever, the university lacked a strong sports scene compared to other schools. While there were Division I teams, they didn't generate the same campus-wide enthusiasm or unity you might find at larger state schools. This contributed to what I felt was not a strong sense of community at GW. The urban campus layout, with buildings spread throughout several city blocks rather than a traditional enclosed campus, sometimes made it difficult to feel connected to the broader student body.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T21:49:02.497112Z","guid":"736d1c03-c4bb-456a-a7b3-e1c75401e09f","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"taedc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b3620674c0af07db6f502a92844050c136530f0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/881ee2057b5e573c7eabaedf066f8299c9b92c8a.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b3620674c0af07db6f502a92844050c136530f0.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a3743d91b38861921a60726bf869dce2ec8b589"},"guid":"6d5f7cd9-e9a2-4ce9-a675-fd3b99484f38","licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/taedc/14350595171/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.0472034,38.8999317,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.0472034,38.8999317,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"ced468c6-6a35-4314-b8a6-42f57855d3be","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.673922507618633,"count":2297},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://undergraduate.admissions.gwu.edu/journey-gw#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/george-washington-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=george-washington-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://undergraduate.admissions.gwu.edu/journey-gw#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"b212d30a-2d53-42db-b405-ed141a637592","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":101,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.421922,"lon":-111.940011},"entity":{"abbreviation":"ASU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4007","ipeds":"104151"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b212d30a-2d53-42db-b405-ed141a637592","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"TEMPE, AZ","name":"Arizona State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"232a0541-c7d3-404a-912b-09d278b00bcf","gradSchool":"2f6f67ad-c3f0-4927-8cd0-4c79a7810adc","metroArea":"0a3be3b4-b128-4c0c-b3ab-37e3773d5e1b","onlineChild":"aa6046f3-672b-456e-b20f-223e577db672","state":"26faec1a-8315-44dd-91e6-2437cbec6490","town":"fd648ad1-f670-4a49-a473-391505438e3e","zipCode":"98d64643-92ab-4b41-b049-96a9bbcb728b"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Arizona State","tagline":["4 Year","TEMPE, AZ"],"type":"College","url":"arizona-state-university","variation":5},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.897518375664071},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14808},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1100-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Arizona State University (ASU) offers an incredible college experience with a vibrant campus life, outstanding academic opportunities, and a welcoming community.

DO NOT come here if you are a vegetarian/vegan, care about healthy eating, or have an allergy. Last week, my friend with a nut allergy broke out in hives after eating a salad (and that's not an isolated incident). There are no vegan/vegetarian/healthy options since Bucknell changed dining providers, and while they made changes over winter break, they made no adjustments to accomodate students who fall into any of these categories. Instead, they added more fried chicken, burgers, and crepes to the menus. You can't even get a hot vegetable in the Bison or Commons dining areas (where upperclassman eat). I've communicated with them through their feedback texts, in a committee meeting, with the nutritionist, and over e-mail and provided multiple ideas on how they could improve things.

The academics are certainly top-notch, and most professors are absolutely wonderful. Grinnell has a special student culture and dynamic that feels different from even other liberal arts colleges. Rural Iowa, albeit often a bit boring, is a surprisingly beautiful and certainly unique place to live for four years. I will say that the workload at Grinnell is really, really intense, and most people I know struggle mentally from the amount of pressure their courses put on them. It can be really hard to find a good work/life balance and this makes it a lot harder to make friends as well. The dining hall (D-hall, as we affectionately call it) is not as bad as students say, but it is certainly not Michelin-level cuisine either. Grinnell's administration is also really poorly run and can be frustrating at times. Overall, I'm happy with my choice, even if I regret it when I'm drowning in homework during my finals week.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-14T15:45:08.142594Z","guid":"1a069bd7-0ec4-459b-8afe-7024405ff49b","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a69c7087801ed0573add681b6107ace4f0482214","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e3a65d69786103a1a9165dab549af0a5a353c080","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3f6af1b002585cccee55aa8ee488d177d2b46693","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8d16dc2cc78b71342b8c74db47957b5bca736ddd"},"guid":"0f6225a8-c4f5-4c24-94f9-e911c72c68b8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-02T18:43:58.328053Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c58d243b672e509e0c954ab71d10aba29e484c1b"},"guid":"01ad1c50-26d6-4131-9cdd-1365d284ef90","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:16:15.913937Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.721246,41.747048,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.721246,41.747048,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"357a7888-a8b8-4f22-ab63-aa0f79834705","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/571e5e1633dd02c746a963a894202536fd2b5116","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/135df6aa669f0ff69640ee47b6d440a1c9ca3b1f"},"guid":"1e9e853d-cba7-476e-b700-5e01c097ba68","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-11-16T22:19:32.708114Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.75,"count":468},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/grinnell?pl=v"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/grinnell-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=grinnell-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/grinnell?pl=v"}]},{"guid":"0b914389-d868-4ecf-970e-60ac8353dde1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":108,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.9985824,"lon":-81.0292128},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SC","alternates":{"ceeb":"5818","ipeds":"218663"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"0b914389-d868-4ecf-970e-60ac8353dde1","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"COLUMBIA, SC","name":"University of South Carolina","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"1136c3e4-92fc-4894-9a8f-eea5433e000a","gradSchool":"a2fbbf9b-b4b1-40bc-8fd5-db81bb2093ef","metroArea":"7d0fa425-6710-4599-b4d2-8fa248be1b5c","state":"4e14b3cc-29b7-46c8-b531-601bf3625739","town":"f27bd3c6-334a-48a9-84b2-e9189f9dce83","zipCode":"c27fa941-11ab-47a8-b8ec-440e4ad28207"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"South Carolina","tagline":["4 Year","COLUMBIA, SC"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6405138902057457},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":22427},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1180-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a current student at the University of South Carolina, my experience has been a mix of excitement and growth. The campus is stunning, especially the historic Horseshoe, and the blend of historic and modern facilities creates an inspiring atmosphere. Professors are approachable, and the university offers excellent resources like tutoring and career services. Gamecock pride is contagious, and football games are an unforgettable highlight of student life. There’s also a wide range of clubs and activities, making it easy to find a community. That said, parking is a challenge it’s expensive and limited. Safety in areas around campus could be improved with better lighting and patrols. Dining options can get repetitive, and some dorms need renovations. Large class sizes in popular majors also make it harder to get individualized attention. Despite these challenges, UofSC offers an incredible experience overall.

I love the many opportunities the University offers for students to become involved!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-27T22:26:42.352948Z","guid":"ce53c653-6344-4e9f-a20d-8fb20ead4df2","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d99e28096c4ffb7d48e8a240a16a6d6606ff9fd6","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a5ba8275a5ba0dbb7274bd9a22a201ef2cbc4a3c","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f9fab3ca36704e10f9805db8debb63687b6000d4","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d3c6b32da02382d3241c64e2b2aa276a6f322be0"},"guid":"27d09905-e4e6-4f50-9119-7c6dea67a262","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-05-09T14:13:42.511199Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c933e0348a089c170cd6df2de0f332e485e11ba9"},"guid":"ccb0b5ac-1dcc-44b2-82ca-8dc64ad58a46","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-17T16:29:01.371073Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3b60c421-1250-45e7-94e2-471546a749e7","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/64974d65cf66f393f5b137d56b76b64b9a454084","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/692b6e18c5ea551a332410209e008aeb8b53f71a"},"guid":"7501996d-5e8e-44d1-8510-f88aa3745d6c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-13T18:20:02.337355Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9172640382317803,"count":3348},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.ou.edu/admissions/visit/virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-oklahoma"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.ou.edu/admissions/visit/virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"134539d5-e860-4c36-85f9-a5cc48d67109","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":113,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.580309,"lon":-101.876917},"entity":{"abbreviation":"TTU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6827","ipeds":"229115"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"134539d5-e860-4c36-85f9-a5cc48d67109","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"LUBBOCK, TX","name":"Texas Tech University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"f00622cd-e62a-4eff-bd76-6c8a9dad4664","gradSchool":"7b5579ae-7012-4e5b-b167-9d3738aac5e1","metroArea":"623bf0e9-ae1c-4d97-aeba-32585787b929","onlineChild":"69d1e0dd-f0dc-4402-9b62-a58d87c73925","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"e90bf5fd-0de4-455c-b5a7-7fa1aa75ca89","zipCode":"24fc38ac-a1a9-409c-99a1-d969ccf1ef42"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Texas Tech","tagline":["4 Year","LUBBOCK, TX"],"type":"College","url":"texas-tech-university","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.673868720620717},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17896},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1090-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Being a student at Texas Tech was the best decision I have ever made. My experience at Texas Tech University has been amazing! I love the vibrant campus atmosphere and the strong sense of community. One of my favorite aspects of Texas Tech is the variety of extracurricular activities and organizations available. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re into academic clubs, cultural groups, or recreational sports. These opportunities have allowed me to make lifelong friends and develop skills outside of the classroom. The sports events, especially football games, are always thrilling and bring everyone together. The campus itself is beautiful with lots of green spaces and spots to relax or study. The community and students here are so fun and amazing it makes you feel at home. If I were to suggest something to change, maybe more diverse food options on campus could be a hit. Also, the housing they are a bit small, and I think they could use an upgrade.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-21T06:36:04.957658Z","guid":"24026c44-783f-4d0e-8f9e-2162079c5a34","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ebba6834d6015167ce1a9cf9e4729219399fb507","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cb41ec3118613917d25b77ec0d33f817f72c6ac","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ebba6834d6015167ce1a9cf9e4729219399fb507","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/153278ab153bb4112fce8d1d1c919690b006531a"},"guid":"4df19d46-80d1-45e1-86f2-488c610e1cab","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6da0da51634bbd01423654521b0e5b1c2a383c56"},"guid":"b2afc5d3-4ac5-485f-aa18-732314a56079","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:04:50.903224Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-101.876917,33.580309,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-101.876917,33.580309,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"92e6a17b-e732-41d2-b6a9-c5cee5b3b8c7","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/670a470c2e987727241abff84f2f9c53259509d8","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/670a470c2e987727241abff84f2f9c53259509d8"},"guid":"dea7c03f-4140-43eb-8bfe-9e29d2b4db47","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.905511811023622,"count":5588},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/ttu"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-tech-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=texas-tech-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/ttu"}]},{"guid":"2903a6b2-8158-4848-8d1a-81ebdbba393c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":114,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.8070323,"lon":-77.858399},"entity":{"abbreviation":"PSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2660","ipeds":"495767"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"2903a6b2-8158-4848-8d1a-81ebdbba393c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"UNIVERSITY PARK, PA","name":"Penn State","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"8b02e65b-0761-42ac-8cda-add86194b033","gradSchool":"7feca99b-13d6-4d05-bea8-706399e4c8bc","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"ee8fc390-31b3-4a2f-a0bd-71ba6e2d28b7","zipCode":"dc4e7b22-4f66-4740-b2f0-f0f4e2d204d3"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Penn State","tagline":["4 Year","UNIVERSITY PARK, PA"],"type":"College","url":"penn-state","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5521771683942067},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":26747},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1210-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Other","body":"Although I’ve been accepted to Penn State and will begin in the fall of 2025, my connection to the university runs deep.

As someone from a Latin American background, I’ve appreciated finding spaces to celebrate my culture and meet others with similar experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-29T17:36:23.987128Z","guid":"036e3545-c933-4a37-b21a-9968e084be3a","helpfulness":4,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c8b5f2d753ea45256cd3a46935916824eb0dae5","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9b6f44da8723e84bca6714d86c8885fea875b879","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a4051e342e1faf7b2be0c24b0f88381581fa6de9","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9b28a3ea40fcd6b05f964bd73ab90af134e46b04"},"guid":"a4c12a1d-360d-403e-a5cb-9da1f085c9c4","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-05-13T14:11:05.804497Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43fb964483505f0ab07f7d53ccc7e9d912d8a4f9"},"guid":"fb0d135f-7408-4ddf-8748-f49ea97eda67","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-05-13T14:12:45.957913Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"241d0700-72c2-44f5-9038-92be39eecacb","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8205243110015683,"count":4463},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.utah.edu/visit-engage/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-utah/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-utah"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.utah.edu/visit-engage/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},{"guid":"89ea0886-4d53-4397-aeb1-5ffbb83b8a78","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":116,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.028541,"lon":-75.314988},"entity":{"abbreviation":"BMC","alternates":{"ceeb":"2049","ipeds":"211273"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"Women's College","guid":"89ea0886-4d53-4397-aeb1-5ffbb83b8a78","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"BRYN MAWR, PA","name":"Bryn Mawr College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"5759da6c-643f-4c8a-9524-7f1e9be0d542","gradSchool":"4affe940-563c-4fd2-afa6-da550b526964","metroArea":"dbdec0e2-fa77-4d1e-9fa2-346eec4a8132","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"5de753d9-7def-4a1b-879e-db01aaa2b996","zipCode":"003c666f-093b-4147-be21-fbcf0f36c706"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Bryn Mawr","tagline":["4 Year","BRYN MAWR, PA"],"type":"College","url":"bryn-mawr-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.30745687256538673},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":39072},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1280-1520"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved going to Bryn Mawr!

There are small class sizes, strong department communities, and extremely professional instructors. There are also many opportunities for research available. The coursework is extremely difficult compared to other universities, so much so, that when employers compare NMT candidates against ones from other schools, they often add a full GPA point to the NMT candidate's application. The campus is small and gorgeous with excellent landscaping and a beautiful field and golf course. As far as social life, it's difficult to make time outside of studies. When you do have free time, there's very few activities available in the town to spend it on. The school hosts many events throughout the year, but these are infrequent and attendance is often low.

Ive made many connections with people that where so beneficial, whether its teachers, friends, or TA's that would help you find your way through college, and with the schools diverse population this definitely helped!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T02:43:52.380381Z","guid":"9b91fed5-5ca3-4901-8ec6-05a318bed6c4","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.1123,33.782752,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.1123,33.782752,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"219985ab-09c1-414d-be1f-52d37fae420b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8420633339972117,"count":5021},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university-long-beach/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-state-university-long-beach"}]},{"guid":"bbe24039-1f41-42fd-b401-7e1eedcb3b24","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":120,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.238942,"lon":-71.808627},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Holy Cross","alternates":{"ceeb":"3282","ipeds":"166124"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"bbe24039-1f41-42fd-b401-7e1eedcb3b24","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WORCESTER, MA","name":"College of the Holy Cross","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"24c6297f-db85-435c-8a28-fdc4bacf2f21","neighborhood":"0577dece-6319-4ddc-a105-96ce53b4aede","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"788404ad-242f-4019-9aef-884820ac53c6","zipCode":"48ef795f-0b69-4406-a131-8ee097d849fc"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Holy Cross","tagline":["4 Year","WORCESTER, MA"],"type":"College","url":"college-of-the-holy-cross","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.3635588402501421},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":34679},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1260-1430"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My overall experience at the College of the Holy Cross has been a mix of positives and negatives. The party culture is strong, especially from Thursday to Sunday, and smoking is quite common. While some students are highly focused on academics, the majority seem more relaxed, and only about 50 freshmen maintain a GPA above 3.5.\n\nOn the bright side, the professors here are very nice and supportive, which makes a big difference in the learning experience. However, the food and housing leave much to be desired. The quality of meals on campus isn’t great, and the living conditions could definitely be improved.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-08T21:17:57.950465Z","guid":"2e9b9022-bea8-49ae-bbbf-45ca937bfcb4","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/98b67ea51047ae40536628ddfcd4f12c56c9dd04","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/203cac2151634bf0a1670164b4ac99f445789f8b","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7708776864ee37bee8544e7103370d66ff6cad44","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/87882e8f937810cb501999dec98f22214d420618"},"guid":"0d1ad5cd-444d-4e61-bf92-cf737ab15405","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-27T17:06:31.499877Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/53511625e2212bf6fbd0bcdb1777eb5ebf4f670f"},"guid":"11b5e375-00b2-45de-8657-f9281ac8c580","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-11-08T14:05:05.322631Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.808627,42.238942,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.808627,42.238942,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"07bc1e04-b22b-4720-be18-e39b4ea70a6a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ddf5d5538d4b0735a24f89fcee464e21524ff868","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a7efce9aa987657126b712a73b1199a698ad4af6"},"guid":"a0791706-1606-4a2c-a9b4-815afb93c5d5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-01-26T19:28:24.726156Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7643097643097643,"count":594},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.holycross.edu/#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-the-holy-cross/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=college-of-the-holy-cross"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.holycross.edu/#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"a1541d26-e31e-4935-91a6-bace82415430","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":121,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.103408,"lon":-117.705939},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Pitzer","alternates":{"ceeb":"4619","ipeds":"121257"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"a1541d26-e31e-4935-91a6-bace82415430","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CLAREMONT, CA","name":"Pitzer College","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ca304750-4dd6-4876-a481-47931f45c082","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","parent":"ca304750-4dd6-4876-a481-47931f45c082","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"fc0052e4-4aa2-46da-946b-470ed8533b2e","zipCode":"50f4ce28-79b1-4045-bd89-233424943937"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Pitzer","tagline":["4 Year","CLAREMONT, CA"],"type":"College","url":"pitzer-college","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.1821515892420538},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":39809},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Coming to Pitzer College was one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

KU is known for their phenomenal sports programs, and attending the sporting events each week allows opportunity for new friendships and a love for sports to be created. There is nothing short of things to do in Lawrence and Kansas City is only twenty minutes away from campus. I greatly enjoyed the nice weather and beautiful campus KU offered this fall! One thing I would like to see change would be an improvement in dining hall food. The options are the same each day and do not taste the best.

Overall, Santa Clara University is a place that embodies the Jesuit value of Cura Personalis, caring for the whole person in mind, body, and spirit.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-27T23:14:30.261113Z","guid":"400be89d-4d02-40dd-907d-2abdf3374665","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fbbc3f0fe5fb4271ff56dcb93f76632d6d316d1b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2155446e4af8729b62a967067ff6f4762b77122","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/19d6a0fa6c915014fc9c8663720bd5afc3697dc6","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9b39cc07260af2bea0cd5072643cc9ccf83a09af"},"guid":"fc8b010d-75bd-4658-956e-fefa2463c825","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-03T20:15:33.659443Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/503d5ef11d57edcb4ed485e0b38c7acc9b94e655"},"guid":"7aad48dd-5a49-4835-97b5-e50f2a933cd5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-11-15T23:36:36.692516Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.938189,37.352706,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.938189,37.352706,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5ee0f18b-72a6-4b69-8152-5d84fca0b063","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f65fbd716c623ab6f534d9c566aa4535fdb89fa","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5876fc612de8b496baa4e4ffde68be5c897a9564"},"guid":"763fb8b4-7be0-4d1b-b227-f53041e5a4bc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-27T21:50:58.553676Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.761431411530815,"count":1509},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.scu.edu/admission/visits-events/virtual-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/santa-clara-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=santa-clara-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.scu.edu/admission/visits-events/virtual-tour/"}]},{"guid":"e603d6f3-da79-4022-b353-e18396dd756a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":124,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.2144769,"lon":-87.5467169},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UA","alternates":{"ceeb":"1830","ipeds":"100751"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e603d6f3-da79-4022-b353-e18396dd756a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"TUSCALOOSA, AL","name":"The University of Alabama","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"33833755-891a-4fba-aff1-7cb6a68c8180","gradSchool":"4b0d8df9-f8eb-41a1-b5c6-fbe3992c5e01","onlineChild":"1f05ce47-c22b-421a-b7b0-69b0448bb4a3","state":"bcace3a7-dc8b-437b-a107-4499869a449a","town":"45d016df-f19f-487c-9467-d8414428553b"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Alabama","tagline":["4 Year","TUSCALOOSA, AL"],"type":"College","url":"the-university-of-alabama","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8005992010652463},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20592},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1130-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience with the University of Alabama’s online program has been nothing short of amazing.

The peers are helpful in homework and notes exchanging, The campus is absolutely beautiful and there are activities one can attend every single day; one can simply never be bored, and the opportunities to get involved in research even as undergraduate students are great! \n\nHowever, as a severely disabled individual (hard of hearing) the resources have not been that great. The office of accessibility and services are not helping students that much, so many students who are disabled have to fend off for themselves. In addition, there are not that many international students and the diversity is not great, having the institution be represented by a predominantly white campus.\n\nYet, other factors such as rigorours academics and a decent party scene and campus life cancel this out!

I also would like to see more organization in communication with students. Sometimes the students have to search out answers, that I feel should be more readily available to them, such as due dates. I also would like to see an expanded variety of online classes offered, as sometimes certain classes you need to graduate are only offered in specific semesters. This delays students who are on track, and can be very frustrating. Overall I would recommend ENMU to anyone however, and I hope to see the University grow soon!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-09T21:41:19.339548Z","guid":"5bc13f29-9c14-49f1-acd9-af5a1564d50a","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.347294,34.17826,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.347294,34.17826,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a3b9921b-b38b-4277-bad3-3769c9076e5c","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7351077313054497,"count":789},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-new-mexico-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=eastern-new-mexico-university"}]},{"guid":"62f0c452-9441-4c5b-b83d-cd8de1a7527c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":131,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.77142,"lon":-117.188721},"entity":{"abbreviation":"USD","alternates":{"ceeb":"4849","ipeds":"122436"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"62f0c452-9441-4c5b-b83d-cd8de1a7527c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"SAN DIEGO, CA","name":"University of San Diego","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"cd82b2c8-1208-47a0-858d-e67d10999c33","gradSchool":"b80e0baf-5c01-4488-82bb-148f3a41d089","metroArea":"71a6a53b-23da-4ec2-b564-ffc13563d4ad","neighborhood":"056ae105-7e24-4ca2-8abb-1f886483384c","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"6d9c7b93-552e-4f06-962e-afc9831390d4","zipCode":"4af47e00-96c1-4605-a25d-a30fec6aa15f"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"USD","tagline":["4 Year","SAN DIEGO, CA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-san-diego","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5260918096832705},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":36008},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1190-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am currently a Sophomore at the University of San Diego.

The rigorous coursework, hands-on clinical training, and supportive faculty helped shape me into the healthcare professional I am today. My time at the UofA laid a strong foundation for my nursing career and future aspirations as a family nurse practitioner and nurse educator. One change I'd like to see would be to increase support and resources for nursing students, especially in terms of clinical placement opportunities and hands-on experience. While the program is well-structured, securing diverse and high-quality clinical rotations can sometimes be challenging. Expanding partnerships with more healthcare facilities, offering more simulation labs, or increasing faculty mentorship opportunities could further enhance the learning experience for future nursing students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-05T19:06:56.732266Z","guid":"c3bfb0da-f670-4bae-8069-a5c346df88b8","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f54163642d0bb4931fa45a1a9cf8d45242b924ff","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cffc69cde9af6a61713082325336dd7029ff48f","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b041a1af292509a2a34511d4530f2561dde1f4bb","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/036915ea10db747d79b057bbc2e2d078cc6bced4"},"guid":"5fda221e-8200-4906-9830-f4e990ba76a5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-24T19:39:10.597336Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.1769533,36.0699572,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.1769533,36.0699572,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"59489dd3-dffd-43b2-abff-1606ba25a6a2","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8917470525187565,"count":3732},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.uark.edu/admissions/virtual-tour/index.php"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-arkansas"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.uark.edu/admissions/virtual-tour/index.php"}]},{"guid":"16e73fef-82a8-4fe4-ae06-3f1392e31d63","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":133,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.088049,"lon":-75.971143},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Binghamton","alternates":{"ceeb":"2535","ipeds":"196079"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"16e73fef-82a8-4fe4-ae06-3f1392e31d63","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"VESTAL, NY","name":"Binghamton University, SUNY","parentGUIDs":{"college":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"5fae0451-9193-4130-8379-4b7028b90d1c","gradSchool":"c4bf2abd-d0b0-4426-b06f-5b489890c12a","onlineChild":"03fae83b-9cd6-472c-a187-5e7b8b3f23d6","parent":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"7493ce1d-edfc-42c6-873a-a41fe09e7278","zipCode":"46260d05-6bcb-44b8-aca4-3e7b5c5df628"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Binghamton","tagline":["4 Year","VESTAL, NY"],"type":"College","url":"binghamton-university-suny","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.4174631381778013},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19535},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1340-1510"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I've had a great time at Binghamton University!

As a Business Administration major concentrating in Real Estate Finance, I’ve had the opportunity to take rigorous courses like Real Estate Investment, Real Estate Finance, and Fixed Income Securities Market, which have helped me build a strong analytical foundation for my career in commercial real estate. Cal Poly’s Learn by Doing philosophy is definitely present in my coursework. Many of my classes are hands-on, requiring case studies, Excel modeling, financial analysis, and real-world applications.  My professors have been knowledgeable and supportive.\nSan Luis Obispo is a beautiful and vibrant town, and I love the outdoor lifestyle—hiking, surfing, and exploring the Central Coast. I’m also involved in Greek Life which has provided leadership and networking opportunities. The Real Estate Club has been another great way to meet like-minded students and industry professionals.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-14T01:37:50.476493Z","guid":"c1f41a79-59f1-4ae0-aa8a-6541aa99be21","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/145f29c978c71d9182bb3ea6c10b0d8a36b2a478","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f788fb528fd878accb02bb39b1a49bb311f3073","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e93df6680fade2e01eb6a4a2da4eb80730b5a27","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2f7b9611f02508bdd4c2a7c25a299f979ee2d8a4"},"guid":"8f83d5aa-aa9d-446a-8fe0-073304a83646","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-03T19:40:10.043301Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ba0d01b4a683a697f29b13ebf34bbaf3c85e0317"},"guid":"76ccff7c-cd22-4934-a42c-342f6c0300ff","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-04-06T18:46:33.70939Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5854ed01-ec33-45ec-a26d-09878c4beab2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b3de9b2371c1cc9d15fdc7d63a8b9ade36ff3243","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8dfaddb6add9f0bceca5e1d930ccb834819a153b"},"guid":"d9077146-0b0c-4380-806f-68768a7074fc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-04-06T18:40:46.29143Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7880421465327125,"count":4081},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.calpoly.edu/explore-cal-poly"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cal-poly-san-luis-obispo/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=cal-poly-san-luis-obispo"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.calpoly.edu/explore-cal-poly"}]},{"guid":"c0f4f6fe-075a-48e7-a9a5-9418b4eba920","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":136,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.364947,"lon":-71.254716},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Brandeis","alternates":{"ceeb":"3092","ipeds":"165015"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"c0f4f6fe-075a-48e7-a9a5-9418b4eba920","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WALTHAM, MA","name":"Brandeis University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"30b8db32-3b30-440f-a944-ef23b93121d2","gradSchool":"d0ecd216-a720-44f9-b72c-bc55b3bd9ef8","metroArea":"1fb5f13a-6673-4bc7-a0c2-fcb7e56d7831","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"f9275ceb-049b-4c50-a0db-c3eef92dff6d","zipCode":"20f7b56b-b9b5-490e-9f76-67ff928a7be6"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Brandeis","tagline":["4 Year","WALTHAM, MA"],"type":"College","url":"brandeis-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.3940707875365534},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":45565},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1370-1530"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My four years at Brandeis were the best years of my life.

Buses can be tricky, some are late or never show up.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-07T21:25:29.067582Z","guid":"9e8e1807-57ba-40bd-ae78-f957f9b02d3f","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"c-chen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ffc5e24c53bf90b27f3233f41b9d3f8022122a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1628fbaa3b25606429ec6955db55878bb4808e.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ffc5e24c53bf90b27f3233f41b9d3f8022122a6.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c7e717a597fd715d684dca9de7a19daa3341afa"},"guid":"cad84d02-d02b-461b-896b-30f401edf65d","licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/c-chen/6266767392/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"0c603900-b748-4363-ab63-720508ee9596","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6865025696510685,"count":3697},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-connecticut/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-connecticut"}]},{"guid":"7d19ae37-bb2c-4ad8-989f-5fd1cd0c45ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":138,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":46.730448,"lon":-117.158168},"entity":{"abbreviation":"WSU","alternates":{"ipeds":"236939"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7d19ae37-bb2c-4ad8-989f-5fd1cd0c45ce","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PULLMAN, WA","name":"Washington State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"780035bd-c556-4cb2-b8ff-b0a26acd45d1","gradSchool":"b07f3e27-0f52-41c2-8d4a-1f094e9e107c","onlineChild":"fd73c87a-7075-47ee-a6e7-1139076ff813","state":"95b0bd28-1551-4c12-9876-7abb43198184","town":"6fffaf94-2ad3-422c-9da0-7eab04a69997"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Washington State","tagline":["4 Year","PULLMAN, WA"],"type":"College","url":"washington-state-university","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8310396371321066},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17911},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1020-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"WSU is a great school and has very many nationally recognized colleges.

This review is a warning to parents about the financial aid process and rising costs each year.  We recieved a great aid package the first year with our contribution coming it at just over $21k.  We assumed this would remain in the same ballpark each year and committed to the school.  Year two our contribution increased to $25k which seemed reasonable, then year three it went up to over $34k.  Our financial aid officer told me there had been a mistake with our income the first two years, we had recieved \"a deal\" and nothing could be done.  We made some sacrifices and made the payments, believing the last year would not cost significatily more because the \"mistake\" had been reconciled.  Well, the aid letter we recieved for year four showed our contribution was over $60k!  I protested the increased and the bill was reduced to just under $50k.  Our income did increase some each year but not at a rate commensurate with our bill.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T23:30:29.675644Z","guid":"648bee77-ec91-4106-82a7-5c71010e77f0","helpfulness":5,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d9bd04c44f29cacb017c11cd6d151c1cef8d526","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c1358d46bccae154d3754a6a8f72a28c2898bad9","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d9bd04c44f29cacb017c11cd6d151c1cef8d526","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cce2b3ca88f92bb2183f299c59ba8621b52a8f94"},"guid":"f2a6caea-4599-4b47-9202-7c98a0bb0c9c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b1e91abbf07adf8d52b410fe0254876bcf4ba84"},"guid":"14b2e100-3cc4-406a-aab1-8669e8e69748","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.573625,42.257588,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.573625,42.257588,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"1c9c6f08-877d-401b-bd50-622fb82b5121","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20bf976869ed81a9046164ad3d292d9ad5d91beb","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/157c3c048188a65afc954dd46a68d6acb8c9c757"},"guid":"dcb63375-b7d5-498d-b77d-5ec2139f3f3b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-17T18:37:55.029218Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.785097192224622,"count":926},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ML2V_V2b0"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-holyoke-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=mount-holyoke-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ML2V_V2b0"}]},{"guid":"f1dc8d0e-2693-406c-a2bf-b626777a7809","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":142,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.2327247,"lon":-110.9508944},"entity":{"abbreviation":"U of A","alternates":{"ceeb":"4832","ipeds":"104179"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f1dc8d0e-2693-406c-a2bf-b626777a7809","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"TUCSON, AZ","name":"University of Arizona","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2bdfedc7-1022-4a52-980c-0d4e51e025c1","gradSchool":"2c598387-8ddd-4524-a63c-8260551cf6e3","metroArea":"eab42399-3436-4c33-8267-9b56203757a5","onlineChild":"ca3b3760-fb87-471b-92cb-af78bc2a7801","state":"26faec1a-8315-44dd-91e6-2437cbec6490","town":"40c01656-6a53-4eab-8c7b-17fd0c826acc","zipCode":"7f67f441-6755-4ae8-9100-38757db5f8eb"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Arizona","tagline":["4 Year","TUCSON, AZ"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-arizona","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8675970897083949},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17075},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have really enjoyed being a student here! The atmosphere is really positive and I have been benefitting from all my classes.

I guess nothing comes for free, but I think I could use a break from my lack of sufficient funding.

Overall, it’s been a positive experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-05T06:00:04.548717Z","guid":"b37906d6-a6bc-495c-a4fb-e0c904c55fe8","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/28e1f82583ab67ef1bbd6e25d8493027f3606553","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fa00d27480fefecfe59d0c0c8a04a0a453a9cfb0","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a08b0d3679a593d2e212b90dd80d3de55fc7714","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/80ed9fc11699423c5643767532c8e770c8905979"},"guid":"53d326b9-59c0-48d0-aa05-a8001e7a2415","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-07-01T20:03:12.959523Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.274721,44.56274,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.274721,44.56274,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"8b54cbbd-20ea-44df-9a2b-a832c5c7169f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7412021177203365,"count":3211},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/virtual-visit"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oregon-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=oregon-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/virtual-visit"}]},{"guid":"8cd719a3-9f66-4a61-a1eb-f2a312b02acc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":148,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.941015,"lon":-92.326429},"entity":{"abbreviation":"MU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6875","ipeds":"178396"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"8cd719a3-9f66-4a61-a1eb-f2a312b02acc","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"COLUMBIA, MO","name":"University of Missouri","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"17af1849-1ef9-425b-94d1-1f85b3f0b6ae","gradSchool":"649ce236-cfbe-427e-8d76-bd774a88b3fc","metroArea":"d746907b-e8fe-4d64-acd5-4fad3976a62f","onlineChild":"de56c0a3-e27e-4ec9-b4b7-168526a12269","state":"efb086dc-e67a-4f09-a4ab-fd83a3ad5321","town":"afbe2259-9f95-4e7f-8b21-624c1b4852ed"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Mizzou","tagline":["4 Year","COLUMBIA, MO"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7912623750184702},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19889},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience has been incredibly rewarding. As an international student, I’ve had the chance to immerse myself in a new culture while building meaningful connections. I love how my university offers diverse opportunities, from academic resources to organizations like the Missouri International Students Council, where I served as Vice President. These roles allowed me to develop leadership skills, work with budgets, and foster a sense of community.\n\nHowever, I’d like to see greater support for international students, particularly in financial aid and job opportunities. The high cost of living on campus often creates challenges, and part-time jobs don’t always cover expenses. More mentorship programs and networking events to connect international and domestic students could also help bridge cultural gaps further. Overall, my experience has been transformative, but these changes could make it even more inclusive and supportive.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-14T19:07:38.254754Z","guid":"7f93337f-2af1-44b0-aa4f-89dcc7385c53","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"adamprocter","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5edd35e63d3375905b22ebc48be7208c6545991b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4d9eefb798b44c81637534c1a4a7fbcabdd54e3a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7dfdfdaeff40b61eb1459bd75770b7dcb0c5e5e7","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/645cd5ced8b0feb7dd693e12fb856cf2445ab6d2"},"guid":"b17f747b-0476-4ed4-92ec-f78cf6c36722","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/adamprocter/537921148/","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-30T16:41:41.234221Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/460be4c8358de9320f9961d778ee2c125c631adb"},"guid":"88eb518e-83c7-446c-b057-d46725aa338c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-17T21:57:19.135464Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.326429,38.941015,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.326429,38.941015,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d5c6b53e-2f78-4e43-8481-86a6030d2553","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.764044943820225,"count":3471},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.missouri.edu/online-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-missouri"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.missouri.edu/online-tour/"}]},{"guid":"8c7f93e4-7738-43ab-81e2-876c5fef63ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":149,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.970633,"lon":-118.415655},"entity":{"abbreviation":"LMU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4403","ipeds":"117946"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"8c7f93e4-7738-43ab-81e2-876c5fef63ce","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"LOS ANGELES, CA","name":"Loyola Marymount University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","gradSchool":"97e54ad0-ae27-484f-b3d7-79f859c04fe0","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","neighborhood":"cadc7612-2e2f-4af8-9554-6ba6be79e270","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"17b8a4a7-f8e8-4c00-8f57-1c87023a02a5","zipCode":"83ccd8e8-4bf8-4805-8769-e388a2dea17b"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Loyola Marymount","tagline":["4 Year","LOS ANGELES, CA"],"type":"College","url":"loyola-marymount-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.41313666743489286},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":52815},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1300-1460"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Loyola Marymount University promotes inclusivity and strives for its students to be global change makers. Although Loyola Marymount University is in an ideal location, and the views are only to be described as breathtaking, that is only one of the multifaceted qualities of this school. From my personal experience, I have made important connections with professors and other fellow students that will last a lifetime. It is refreshing to finally engage in an environment where students and professors encourage those to succeed. Furthermore, my homework load is challenging, but it is not unbearable. I have always been involved in extra curricular activities, in addition to school, so college has only furthered my driven mindset. Lastly, I enjoy the unlimited opportunities provided by the group organizations on campus. I have received a countless amount of network possibilities in both Marketing and Dance fields, solely due to my affiliation in both programs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-30T17:28:52.192021Z","guid":"fade4fc2-7413-4c17-8ef5-ef95d7c6cb06","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"adangarcia","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7e9cb587cf6b0552604f99d4050e302eb531bad1","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e610f5cd190127f4b06a1e78f935668ab6ccea45","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/95a2003b14b4ea741b8692c0085acad5afe489f1","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a2f8f3eca8719ad0149b0171554dc110d832f37"},"guid":"55a4e14f-0440-42f1-b4af-49d11c6d4440","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/adangarcia/2810418976/","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-05T20:53:05.825059Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3ac24f52f2bcf1b8e28c645b34467a5f8c84ff93"},"guid":"27b66724-352a-4c1e-8130-d33e33d499a8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-08T23:31:02.458451Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.415655,33.970633,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.415655,33.970633,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"fa3d9be0-6e9e-4e86-86f3-002479d16bfb","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aa0b8ca1c38d689d4ca075746c8c5efe23ba3811","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e404d36e7972614d38b56d150f068a9226834c3"},"guid":"1ecce34c-a3d1-4365-b111-55d5358809f2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-08T18:42:46.364946Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7832402234636873,"count":1790},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admission.lmu.edu/virtualvisit/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/loyola-marymount-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=loyola-marymount-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admission.lmu.edu/virtualvisit/"}]},{"guid":"26d015a7-badf-47b5-9641-2f2d2a3e9a10","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":150,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.954855,"lon":-75.188745},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Drexel","alternates":{"ceeb":"2194","ipeds":"212054"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"26d015a7-badf-47b5-9641-2f2d2a3e9a10","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PHILADELPHIA, PA","name":"Drexel University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"58db4be1-4d78-44f5-aa68-1f486cd6f05e","gradSchool":"c86ae7f0-85fc-4ef7-aefe-534caa81fd96","metroArea":"dbdec0e2-fa77-4d1e-9fa2-346eec4a8132","neighborhood":"3ce36bba-f60a-4ea7-b048-c42a1abc5c9c","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"f348a217-d5b6-4bec-91be-79a57bc282c1","zipCode":"464fd4de-8dd6-423f-8357-4bd641b44edb"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Drexel","tagline":["4 Year","PHILADELPHIA, PA"],"type":"College","url":"drexel-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7965154503616042},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":39267},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1230-1430"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"As an alum of Drexel University, I can confidently say it was the perfect choice for me. Growing up in the suburbs, I wanted a truly immersive city experience, and Drexel's prime location in Philadelphia provided just that. The vibrant urban environment offered endless opportunities for exploration, learning, and cultural enrichment.\n\nWhat truly set Drexel apart for me was its renowned co-op program. It gave me invaluable real-world work experience that not only enhanced my education but also prepared me for life after graduation.\n\nThat said, Drexel is undeniably expensive, and even 12 years later, I’m still paying off my student loans. Despite the cost, I highly recommend it. The unique combination of a city lifestyle and hands-on professional opportunities made my experience at Drexel both life-changing and worth every penny.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-17T18:46:30.855135Z","guid":"496f23d8-b547-4155-94d2-d00723a358dd","helpfulness":3,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/66dfdc1c1b757ad292f0a5c9de5f4fb6f99d85b3","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b1c4af3d9602e7cfb2de975d1ebbc44209871075","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26416f438fcad8d87ac1761d08a223c861f9b673","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/accb6b5e1db0620b5b17b5673b3190511afdd394"},"guid":"ce46143d-c9d8-46d9-af89-710ee3ff2bc0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-06T20:16:09.222156Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/714928f001ef66f4d73148404c5b1bfacc758d00"},"guid":"de71817e-6b19-4b34-8ba0-7c6a27e4173f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-17T20:35:44.46001Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.188745,39.954855,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.188745,39.954855,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"dde68631-b568-4b2e-9e13-88d99087ee70","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e6c55db37844d77fdf6f540fd59754de22e49474","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ec7a7f76999c73d6adc8c48e85aad6bd18079d7b"},"guid":"93dc36db-afde-4734-99b4-b86d8ee44cce","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-10T14:39:18.98886Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.618453105968331,"count":3284},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://drexel.edu/admissions/visit-tours"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/drexel-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=drexel-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://drexel.edu/admissions/visit-tours"}]},{"guid":"96e167fa-2639-4a59-ba5c-acd651daff72","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":151,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.77525,"lon":-117.071228},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SDSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4682","ipeds":"122409"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"96e167fa-2639-4a59-ba5c-acd651daff72","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"SAN DIEGO, CA","name":"San Diego State University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"cd82b2c8-1208-47a0-858d-e67d10999c33","gradSchool":"0966ba01-b026-4321-82f6-0af96aa63d6d","metroArea":"71a6a53b-23da-4ec2-b564-ffc13563d4ad","neighborhood":"e3746b52-dd1e-4b2d-a560-2877dfd24ba4","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"6d9c7b93-552e-4f06-962e-afc9831390d4","zipCode":"bb5c3f41-7d62-45db-b24d-89b97a74df86"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"San Diego State","tagline":["4 Year","SAN DIEGO, CA"],"type":"College","url":"san-diego-state-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.39263430420711976},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13017},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1090-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I would like more trees and greenery on campus!

The school might not be a party school but the people find meaningful ways to pass their time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-09-17T21:15:38.01401Z","guid":"f864498a-0dd9-4937-8301-369e3316e871","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.020209,41.240879,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.020209,41.240879,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"60653c8f-569b-4458-aa6f-09291d30bab9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.663716814159292,"count":226},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.csm.edu/virtual-campus-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-saint-mary/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=college-of-saint-mary"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.csm.edu/virtual-campus-tour"}]},{"guid":"396a7833-3261-4b0e-ba73-ca3a037316b0","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":155,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":46.7285,"lon":-117.009},"entity":{"abbreviation":"U of I","alternates":{"ceeb":"4843","ipeds":"142285"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"396a7833-3261-4b0e-ba73-ca3a037316b0","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MOSCOW, ID","name":"University of Idaho","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"4ba7a32e-1112-4f56-bbcc-c26d720d47e6","gradSchool":"2a6110a3-3259-4791-84e4-f91067a61013","state":"62e50d35-04b0-4d45-946c-4f754a822d13","town":"b98d7f90-a96e-436c-b56e-5e0988c1fe05","zipCode":"f7442a88-8e85-45d3-88d2-b9982060dbf9"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"U of I","tagline":["4 Year","MOSCOW, ID"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-idaho","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7385201224520271},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14954},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"990-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at the University of Idaho has been rewarding and enriching.

Professors were always open to office hours while academics were rigorous and challenging (the fact that every student worked hard was a motivating factor as well). I felt that I developed strong friendships that will last a lifetime. Having Bible studies and weekly worship were also crucial in my walk of faith and developing a sense of community on campus.\nOne (rather small) critique that I have is housing. I believe it is essential that students have the option to live off-campus and/or have more options to live in their own rooms.\nOne other thing to note is that Wheaton is a great school for those who know their calling. The academics, connections, and community will encourage and help build the skills you need to get to the next step. For those who are a little lost in terms of career plans, this can be a harder environment to be in (though I still encourage you to apply/visit).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-29T03:33:06.096125Z","guid":"0d562730-4d6b-4f74-9ad9-b7d0e13a6861","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/95b1c2a894a4986a4fe1cc2bcc7657e8b7600025","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/66038d5a235a8f531d900b86a1e19ce0ca060e2b","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062805065d0dba39c4f077128456f17c4a8e98cf","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b3ec9353486b30eb94151a41ab30f1c3f83de095"},"guid":"12974e60-078c-4e47-9e86-8e4e4f9768da","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-03T15:05:32.910882Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9483564565770b484fc33285f3e97b63cacfc75e"},"guid":"6bfd9c4c-1a83-45e5-ae55-aa0d19b39ed0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-03T14:19:17.547548Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"2c66ca41-6598-42cb-841b-38b18c27b225","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/117a66610c9b1b9300014e601d19df3a0d2de24f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b82b996f0cd34d736709023ffcb9b27883a03196"},"guid":"3c36d75d-ce67-4900-b047-a7c75b16ab5f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-02T16:49:01.646186Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.0085227272727275,"count":704},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.wheaton.edu/about-wheaton/visit-wheaton/video-campus-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wheaton-college-illinois/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=wheaton-college-illinois"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.wheaton.edu/about-wheaton/visit-wheaton/video-campus-tour/"}]},{"guid":"1e8f6bd2-1d23-4bba-992b-165f20d1def2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":158,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":29.719988,"lon":-95.344851},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UH","alternates":{"ceeb":"6870","ipeds":"225511"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"1e8f6bd2-1d23-4bba-992b-165f20d1def2","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"HOUSTON, TX","name":"University of Houston","parentGUIDs":{"college":"92fa2604-6c99-4b09-b8f0-61d6996916f6","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"125697c7-5b80-4c39-a192-dd7c6c9422f9","gradSchool":"d0d57b8f-aa84-44f9-87ff-b3ce92141bab","metroArea":"77c890e1-5b09-4a33-b0fe-9defd7c77f94","neighborhood":"3ff7a50d-5f5d-4edd-af6a-00ad2afeab4a","parent":"92fa2604-6c99-4b09-b8f0-61d6996916f6","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"14c096e9-d877-4d24-b414-eb1d24c9f04a","zipCode":"ac6f62a9-2af3-4056-8918-b68ded8c6197"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Houston","tagline":["4 Year","HOUSTON, TX"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-houston","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.662391297048652},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14056},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1160-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"University of Houston was a great school to attend for my undergraduate.

Beyond academics, Rose-Hulman provides countless opportunities to grow, with a welcoming student body and a vibrant residence life.

The college's commitment to a rigorous, yet supportive academic environment has allowed me to thrive in my chosen field of study. The small class sizes foster meaningful interactions with professors, who are not only experts in their fields but also genuinely invested in students' success. This personalized approach to education has been one of the most impactful aspects of my time at Lafayette.\n\nOne of the things I value most is the sense of community at Lafayette. With a student body that is relatively small, I have had the opportunity to collaborate closely with peers, engage in research, and contribute to campus life through various student organizations. This tight-knit environment has provided me with both a solid academic foundation and a deep sense of belonging, helping me grow as a person and a professional.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-17T02:23:20.409093Z","guid":"ad8fc97e-0fbc-45d3-8b95-58e144fd95dd","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1cd1a29a4e9c08e01b1752a79474370c0acf2fa5","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b0b61d00227f51925eeb1ddd2c825709693e6938","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3bc3f82c62eb83a127c5de3833d196af3eb8ad14","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/60ef34262198a7d4adc5167b4d334cbe73e8fc55"},"guid":"75ffb9eb-193e-4e71-9cdc-4880538b96d8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-21T16:48:11.373348Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca93896497034d6548d291b5e236cf24b632ca96"},"guid":"0d1f1891-e7ee-4183-a413-3333421c90bf","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-21T18:27:46.462386Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.2079306,40.7002085,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.2079306,40.7002085,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c089a4e8-e125-4eb3-bd2c-7f73905c31fa","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.642857142857143,"count":686},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/lafayette?pl=v"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lafayette-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=lafayette-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/lafayette?pl=v"}]},{"guid":"d76168c3-820c-45d2-a6d3-11bba418756b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":162,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.8745525,"lon":-87.6574711},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UIC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1851","ipeds":"145600"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d76168c3-820c-45d2-a6d3-11bba418756b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CHICAGO, IL","name":"University of Illinois Chicago","parentGUIDs":{"college":"a32f0b7c-e970-4162-b986-77bf6d721f98","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"7bfb22bd-ca33-4718-905f-26a408664726","gradSchool":"f6b990ba-416f-48e4-851b-2371a8379650","metroArea":"b1fe05c5-1876-422b-81a7-8dfa8da9acfd","neighborhood":"7288580a-8666-48df-9779-f5470634bca0","parent":"a32f0b7c-e970-4162-b986-77bf6d721f98","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"33384739-287e-4fab-8d93-0bb2e87603e7","zipCode":"f2911736-7bbc-4cb6-82f7-fe3f32c5ac2b"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"UI Chicago","tagline":["4 Year","CHICAGO, IL"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-illinois-chicago","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7869026398438164},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10384},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1110-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My overall experience with the University of Illinois Chicago has been both enriching and diverse, shaped by the university's commitment to academic excellence, cultural diversity, and community engagement.

This review might be premature, but she is loving life.  We are thrilled with how well she is doing, and how excited she is to be there.  It's comforting knowing your daughter is attending a school with a safe campus, and a caring faculty.  We visited an excessive amount of schools, and Furman was the one campus that the entire family liked.  The campus is beautiful, the student body looks normal, the faculty had the right answers to our questions, and the campus is secure.  During our TOURS we engaged as many students as possible, and this is the only campus that 100% of the students could have a mature intelligent conversation.  Her classes have been difficult but fair.  The professors have been encouraging and available when she has questions.  Importantly, there is no political unrest on campus which I attribute to the normal looking students that can have an adult conversation.  The food is good too.

My first year, I was able to take a variety of classes in different departments to figure out where I felt most at home, and many of our classes are interdisciplinary.

They truly are a great resource that I was not expecting to have, especially coming from a bigger high school. I have been fortunate to hold several campus jobs, including being a tour guide, tutor, and RA. There are also tons of opportunities for students to get involved in administrative, career-preparing work through our SGA and various campus committees--most searches and voting committees will have at least one student representative, and overall the opportunities are vast.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2023-03-06T15:56:04.805365Z","guid":"1ece9bc4-4fac-4b20-a28f-32defb2e77a9","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/771f79e437d6e1da302edf2a219e54f82e9fae78","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fad1f2013064dfa888813fbe3624e819ea4668cf","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70f8bab8cd5b4c76decf3b2aa11b5a41c57469ec","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/66382eb8c075e2c23337abc53ffaf498cb4b45a0"},"guid":"185097a1-6fc8-4e1c-9437-8ec15bfb153c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-24T21:44:10.100956Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/75d718966021db1514edf73705617427864f3cfc"},"guid":"24144186-cae9-4f88-94b6-fda9f17b8262","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-13T16:26:10.390022Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"57a2741b-f2ab-4e70-9c3a-b56904ecb31d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5f0ef2107257ea5fd60d5c9c3dc19fd87624e029","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f4a7dc0a83aee7e960765573bc44c14c0d243b60"},"guid":"94d2f930-45c4-4e25-baa9-fc4cf0eb02cb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-13T16:43:38.741114Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.753265602322206,"count":689},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/visit/int-tour.php"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/skidmore-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=skidmore-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/visit/int-tour.php"}]},{"guid":"d9c8ac5f-72f9-45e2-9ddb-88bc3655a2f6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":165,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.616019,"lon":-93.238174},"entity":{"abbreviation":"The College","alternates":{"ceeb":"6713","ipeds":"178697"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d9c8ac5f-72f9-45e2-9ddb-88bc3655a2f6","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"POINT LOOKOUT, MO","name":"College of the Ozarks","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"7dd17dfb-0987-4c74-8595-4733f463eea1","state":"efb086dc-e67a-4f09-a4ab-fd83a3ad5321","town":"3e4f8ac1-72f9-47cb-b794-6ab0957a5c1e","zipCode":"31dd3b41-d279-4ef8-8f58-6072ba36bec6"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"College of the Ozarks","tagline":["4 Year","POINT LOOKOUT, MO"],"type":"College","url":"college-of-the-ozarks","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.21125502456453774},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12611},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1040-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"College of the Ozarks is quite different than most University's. For starters they offer there excellent work program that offers students the opportunity to have their full tuition paid in full while still having to pay for room and board. But besides the point life on campus is quite nice. It takes time to grow into what you want to be here, but is that not the same for any college? This school teaches you great time management skills of both work time, school time, and trying to fit in personal time when you can. There bachelors programs are all excellent offering niche majors alongside some of the best programs in the state of Missouri such as Nursing. Most people in the Midwest area if they see a College of Ozarks student apply for a job, they will hire them. But other than that it has taken me some time but this place has grown on me exponentially.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-13T15:42:15.325493Z","guid":"a6b59cc1-cf71-4bec-bf97-ab9e7f8ac96d","helpfulness":4,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.238174,36.616019,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.238174,36.616019,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"ebc3c6c1-7da3-4fb5-b22b-9069285ee6a0","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8341346153846154,"count":416},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-the-ozarks/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=college-of-the-ozarks"}]},{"guid":"5713e47f-56bb-4c69-931d-d70beaff0b2d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":166,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.713295,"lon":-117.251204},"entity":{"abbreviation":"PLNU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4605","ipeds":"121309"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"5713e47f-56bb-4c69-931d-d70beaff0b2d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SAN DIEGO, CA","name":"Point Loma Nazarene University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"cd82b2c8-1208-47a0-858d-e67d10999c33","gradSchool":"ad7e96e3-2e8e-468c-9640-965d9251a09c","metroArea":"71a6a53b-23da-4ec2-b564-ffc13563d4ad","neighborhood":"141900da-b0f5-4e4d-bc53-81debd86b23e","onlineChild":"205e40d3-c620-49d6-a722-255b042eaf2e","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"6d9c7b93-552e-4f06-962e-afc9831390d4","zipCode":"9f8af2bd-4ef2-4fc8-a28d-ceb3d5f2fbb3"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Point Loma Nazarene","tagline":["4 Year","SAN DIEGO, CA"],"type":"College","url":"point-loma-nazarene-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8193077167354715},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":34933},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1170-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"The professors at PLNU care about their students and are passionate about teaching. The quality of academics is fairly good compared to other small liberal arts schools. Student body pool size is very small compared to a state school which gives it sort of a high school social feel versus a traditional college campus. Looking back I would have preferred going to a bigger school with more students and school spirit. There's really no school spirit around sporting events other than homecoming. Chapel is a requirement to attend a couple of days a week for undergraduate students. If you don't attend you must pay a fee for every chapel missed. Faith is a very important element at the school which I wasn't fully aware of before attending. About half of the students hold their Christian values tightly and there seems to be sort of a clique separating religious/not very religious students.  The campus is on the beach with a beatiful view from classrooms and dorms which is a redeeming quality.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-07T23:28:01.549746Z","guid":"8b3e2e96-b2a0-45c9-b956-6e4e823b2a8e","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/61668f0dc7c640a89fcc3846cab35e875785a73b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/82db81dff761aa8bf07da28c28cbe994ac5a914a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/59c4b414432ad9e12930d23a98161c81026ab5d0","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d3740e362f306c00ea9a0e49b35b210dea777728"},"guid":"398cf781-23fd-45ce-ab11-2ef70039bbe9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-01-18T17:33:22.772812Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e98cd5b5ae5c3fb16002cd7f49752d964d5bb497"},"guid":"fd551fb0-dc89-4ddd-a850-a92660d1cf7e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-08T18:19:18.546663Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.251204,32.713295,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.251204,32.713295,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c6f4cfd3-0c21-4898-9d4b-880413adf763","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/423b78b0a315f4963b50076346577d51c34ae261","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1e02cfdf36db886ec4f2b29aff917374a0fd929e"},"guid":"b054d237-0fdb-44bf-82a9-fac5ec8debe5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-20T19:21:10.206753Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.790610328638498,"count":1065},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/visit/experience-virtual-plnu"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/point-loma-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=point-loma-nazarene-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/visit/experience-virtual-plnu"}]},{"guid":"76ef9c66-beb9-4ad6-b413-b995d78a9a4c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":167,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.679791,"lon":-75.7536},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UD","alternates":{"ceeb":"5811","ipeds":"130943"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"76ef9c66-beb9-4ad6-b413-b995d78a9a4c","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"NEWARK, DE","name":"University of Delaware","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"7d5b6415-40b1-49e1-b1dc-36ef6220feef","gradSchool":"50a3a030-0025-46a9-98e6-c72cb273332e","metroArea":"dbdec0e2-fa77-4d1e-9fa2-346eec4a8132","state":"fe96f6ce-46a2-4748-91c2-e13389f5d305","town":"dc4edeef-43a4-4574-a90f-1ef759830a29","zipCode":"0700fb03-651f-470b-bdee-b45774f91fb9"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UD","tagline":["4 Year","NEWARK, DE"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-delaware","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7381087042588089},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":18044},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1190-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Though I have only been on campus for half of a year, Delaware is a beautiful university that has already brought me some of my life-long friendships, and it has truly brought me out of my comfort zone!

As a recent graduate, now that I am finished with my time as an Ole I always look back on it fondly. It is a perfect size - and with Carleton close by, there are more social opportunities than a small school would typically provide. As someone with a Carl as a partner, Olaf was definitely the better experience of the two. I am always surprised how many people around the world know St. Olaf. Olaf is a great choice if you're interested in study abroad, building a strong community and has alums that are passionate about the school. Rural Minnesota can be boring, but this leading to students staying on campus and spending time with one another. It can be difficult to get to the cities. The administration is also very compassionate and really wants to help. I also recommend visiting the many cultural events on campus - I loved all of the student theater events throughout the semester! Olaf is also a great choice for avoiding Greek life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-01T11:42:13.202794Z","guid":"6b3d57c1-a15e-4385-8cf6-f4f925b30995","helpfulness":3,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3e991c61f3c3a96332c3c265cd19762827baf14a","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/714a6391e806d99dad0882706ffc7b0227ff53c2","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b073c63e07ae4c48582024484ec860f39f1e879b","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c5ac347c03f0067692644fe3b33a23d3b37057ca"},"guid":"b2758f9f-9ffd-46af-beee-7fed4f54da00","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-16T15:35:53.390515Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c957674f8e4e2a2039e7749ee4d0b3de12a24e2e"},"guid":"991bda33-c4df-46ac-ae6c-266242defe71","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-27T20:14:55.790423Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"97eeb26d-30bb-4a98-9fae-505e79af9721","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e0108513021d0e7b9cf3265438334abf63b71803","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b4d836e4bac5f08ee3f82d3bfd7c798a41e40969"},"guid":"810a7993-a696-44cc-8fc2-42180661b480","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-27T20:15:47.617769Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7192118226600983,"count":812},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://wp.stolaf.edu/admissions/visit/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-olaf-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=st-olaf-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://wp.stolaf.edu/admissions/visit/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},{"guid":"2693c41f-c465-4b35-9f72-cf0c84c54d7b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":170,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.728983,"lon":-73.678768},"entity":{"abbreviation":"RPI","alternates":{"ceeb":"2757","ipeds":"194824"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"2693c41f-c465-4b35-9f72-cf0c84c54d7b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"TROY, NY","name":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"554968ba-7a42-42e4-9d43-bcef803978be","gradSchool":"7c8ac0b0-721c-4291-ac27-0ca28c951e62","metroArea":"0126e2f4-1dd5-40d2-a2b3-46b4409d4872","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"5d3e475a-0cae-4f41-a850-569b109479a5","zipCode":"5d95fd7a-df5d-4c25-9a81-c892c9b2afa0"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"RPI","tagline":["4 Year","TROY, NY"],"type":"College","url":"rensselaer-polytechnic-institute","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6453833372893425},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":39127},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1360-1520"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"A nice school for geeks and nerds alike, uplifting each other in exploring the field of engineering.

I do think some older dorms could use some work; newer, albeit more expensive dorms and cafeterias were pretty good, though.

I have gotten involved in a varsity sport, Greek life, and other clubs and organizations which have made the campus feel like home. I came to WPI because I knew I wanted to do fire protection engineering but was worried about being so far from home. Though getting adjusted to campus was a little rocky, as soon as I started getting involved all my fears faded. Walking around campus I always see familiar faces and have never once felt unsafe even when walking to friends' apartments off campus.

The university is beautiful, facilities amazing and education is top-notch. I was well-prepared to enter my field (business management). The educators truly care about their students.  Harding truly seeks excellence.  They have some rules in place that some feel are too restrictive, but its a trade-off for keeping a culture that is God honoring as well as safe. The school is not urban, though it's not far from Little Rock.  I liked that the fact that most students travel great distances to attend Harding stay there through the weekends. It makes campus life a lot of fun at all times. Harding also has several campuses worldwide (Africa, Italy, Australia, Greece, etc) where students can attend. Harding is not for everybody, but it's truly a place, in my opinion, which provided me with an amazing experience I could get nowhere else.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-20T21:52:11.490711Z","guid":"432aa60e-a491-497e-8e81-0b958013f4fe","helpfulness":2,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/36f58e9a645dfbaeb36e7e344442a26e3d512b14.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9d65a6a61f1cdafd6bb8ad51fbf86e3e2366df8f.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/36f58e9a645dfbaeb36e7e344442a26e3d512b14.jpg"},"guid":"cb30db6e-24aa-409e-9f76-be3851c0b4e7","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a98f0a3fed15ec3cc31c80cccead2802192415a5"},"guid":"de24ba30-6882-405f-929a-3b2c076d9c7b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-17T15:26:41.51997Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.729008,35.249605,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.729008,35.249605,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"79a1efb0-a0d0-4882-99b7-760ee86d0bb9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9157706093189963,"count":1116},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youtu.be/GUfUv-MKR8M"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harding-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=harding-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youtu.be/GUfUv-MKR8M"}]},{"guid":"358da127-82ac-490e-bb8a-58b5b6384bfc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":174,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":30.428599,"lon":-84.285664},"entity":{"abbreviation":"FAMU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5215","ipeds":"133650"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"358da127-82ac-490e-bb8a-58b5b6384bfc","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"TALLAHASSEE, FL","name":"Florida A&M University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"da9e9870-a924-4f1c-937e-2c5c6645e7e0","gradSchool":"970d0eb7-8a9e-4472-8df4-569c8e48acc1","metroArea":"d1531b58-2d49-4870-8e19-efdb563f78ad","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","town":"31e77cad-6091-4f2c-b2b4-67f0fe080f4b","zipCode":"63edd30e-2d37-4b7b-9b82-ad1bd7ab2a38"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Florida A&M","tagline":["4 Year","TALLAHASSEE, FL"],"type":"College","url":"florida-a-and-m-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.32929194956353053},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":11583},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1010-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at Florida A&M University has been amazing so far.

There are events almost every weekend to ensure students are having fun while also getting their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-25T02:55:19.692394Z","guid":"36332941-06c6-456c-8103-03a056b0d91c","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a1429955-a57b-45e7-a5a5-2618f1858e4d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6349769421780773,"count":2819},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=florida-a-and-m-university"}]},{"guid":"1cdf907c-1b8c-4174-9277-c67d6a59d677","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":175,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.040525,"lon":-76.136738},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2823","ipeds":"196413"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"1cdf907c-1b8c-4174-9277-c67d6a59d677","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"SYRACUSE, NY","name":"Syracuse University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"28a5d042-fda4-4889-950c-49ffa0a38969","gradSchool":"cf6a958d-09e0-4028-b8fb-08cacf2f722c","metroArea":"b3afcfda-9914-49b1-bf61-849b0e8454f6","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"5ea50880-17ee-4003-b9fe-f167f7e065f1","zipCode":"8ae6befc-1f74-49ce-a294-3275c7acb620"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Syracuse","tagline":["4 Year","SYRACUSE, NY"],"type":"College","url":"syracuse-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5175106654775965},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":43651},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1260-1430"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"As an introvert, the party scene at Syracuse University was a bit daunting, but after my four years here I can confidently say you do not need to be a partier to have fun here.

I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts in Integrative Psychology program and am incredibly grateful for the holistic-focused classes available.

Additionally, National University’s four-week course schedules have proven to be a great structure for learning. Overall, my experience with National University has been outstanding, and I look forward to continuing my journey with such a supportive and well-structured institution.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-08T03:55:35.25441Z","guid":"32089a0f-ef3d-4058-83c7-f973799d0e1d","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.244243,32.909469,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.244243,32.909469,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"6a2df9cc-7c53-43da-b234-c52245237ca2","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.981132075471698,"count":1219},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/national-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=national-university"}]},{"guid":"b21a90df-109d-4ced-ae82-7df91c120f2f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":179,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":30.542855,"lon":-87.218125},"entity":{"abbreviation":"West Florida","alternates":{"ceeb":"5833","ipeds":"138354"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b21a90df-109d-4ced-ae82-7df91c120f2f","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"PENSACOLA, FL","name":"University of West Florida","parentGUIDs":{"college":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"97d57e19-153d-4610-bc29-c7c0c8d19073","gradSchool":"b1960c01-3061-4dbd-a780-5d3bce6c7cf9","metroArea":"b217988a-3250-4073-8e51-d50cd730076d","onlineChild":"3a9e96f8-918f-4317-a831-633b7d9269c4","parent":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","town":"813445fb-bb2e-4a51-b724-01736d6b679b","zipCode":"57958ac4-ec13-4647-94a2-e18190bf9208"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"West Florida","tagline":["4 Year","PENSACOLA, FL"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-west-florida","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.48030286404038186},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":8609},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1050-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It was great!

You will just have to work hard for the four years until then.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-19T05:27:28.359444Z","guid":"358a2ff9-2470-40b8-9c86-8d5cf22f5643","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d6b87fa164a72c684b47eeedb9407287f4ff7622","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bef8e29bf2a98bdd8a8969182b6f6c30a429d72f","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5ab26999883cf0bb2fe24dc94bc5be9fdbcb333d","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9838d4db7b176535aaece1e31d517022c8d6019f"},"guid":"7ff1715f-f7a8-4e81-a5c3-6ef4f103ef48","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-05-26T22:04:33.759948Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2b3e2122ad74898db5cb2b4428f3a5c6c901fa0"},"guid":"afc080a9-03d9-4fef-b085-1504ae0f453e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-12-13T16:07:28.760601Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.205753,44.075439,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.205753,44.075439,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"cdce9437-2413-41dd-a5e6-e5afdfe2bbfe","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/91fbe6f2b9943336c2580e630776973caa5aacc6","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9bcfa0f23afaf7a5053f6077d527619ed1a5f62c"},"guid":"672a905e-7c49-4319-8222-9a0bd4a03f2b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-05-26T21:53:43.334393Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6970873786407767,"count":515},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youtu.be/nXzquYHftO4"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/south-dakota-school-of-mines-and-technology/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=south-dakota-school-of-mines-and-technology"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youtu.be/nXzquYHftO4"}]},{"guid":"4fa61b7f-bd1a-40eb-9843-098177afbda2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":183,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.151887,"lon":-95.945175},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UTulsa","alternates":{"ceeb":"6883","ipeds":"207971"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"4fa61b7f-bd1a-40eb-9843-098177afbda2","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"TULSA, OK","name":"The University of Tulsa","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"68d40a5d-c383-482e-96c7-0aef890f7d4a","gradSchool":"e8696654-5eb9-4c65-8b2c-0d9979f2e872","metroArea":"532163b9-fe06-47e2-a3c6-0966a366accd","state":"3c47e197-7bb5-4d24-80d6-d7c74202b941","town":"71b783a6-6be0-449d-a6f5-d481edbeb903","zipCode":"1b2c5dcd-b8d7-4b60-86f9-587b77d9a8a2"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Tulsa","tagline":["4 Year","TULSA, OK"],"type":"College","url":"the-university-of-tulsa","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7022642784724569},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":28087},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1080-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Walking through Tulsa University’s campus, I feel immense pride as the first in my family to attend college. The isolation can be real. Many of my classmates come from families where college is expected, even assumed. They have guidance from parents and family who all have done this before. Meanwhile, I’m figuring everything out on my own financial aid, class schedules, internships where to fit in, But there’s also strength in that. Each step forward is a personal victory, proof that I deserve to be here every day. Even though the surrounding area isn’t the most inspiring, inside the universitys walls, I feel limitless. I’m absorbing knowledge, making connections, and proving to myself and my family that I belong in a place like this. College life is more than just learning for me it’s a path to transformation. I am determined to persevere and succeed against all odds. I belong here and no student loan, confusing equations, or overpriced textbook will stop me from succeeding!

The campus is vibrant, and the faculty members are dedicated to helping students succeed. I appreciate the variety of resources available, from the well-stocked library to the support provided by academic advisors. The university offers a strong academic curriculum that has challenged me while providing opportunities for personal and professional growth. The diversity of the student body creates a welcoming environment for individuals from all walks of life. I would love to see more internship and hands-on learning opportunities to help students connect theory to real-world experiences. Overall, Stony Brook has provided a solid foundation for my academic and career aspirations.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-07T20:03:59.418509Z","guid":"5ba995c4-ccd6-4abd-942b-a34e5234de25","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f1f45e8b7c75ab3e31bdb6e0975b6437818e643c","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/288bcafe8d46e4fb2c40a073c62adc2b0a2fd33f","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d999655e5efb0c999f27ea04670e3e2c4f73ec16","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0f0a6b910392f02da722e4d8b6f276a37a98e02e"},"guid":"243e4667-2513-43a6-aa36-a3f092eb8a5c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-15T18:13:36.038364Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a37dace37adb3ec2142dcd5c83f4f4a97325619c"},"guid":"3f212991-4bdf-464b-90b8-87219cf0d589","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-08-30T18:45:19.535848Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.1227708,40.9155336,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.1227708,40.9155336,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5512ced2-7735-4f3e-a934-486f3234787b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ede1c9e0a3a27dd8ed846cec528363e2b664c1eb","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2e2a1a2db4bba271cbd7c78775e061d980d2d603"},"guid":"f97a84ea-0cb0-4c5a-a512-f1ca22bae56b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-27T18:32:34.348524Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5550287842871655,"count":2953},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.stonybrook.edu/undergraduate-admissions/visit/virtual-tour.php"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/stony-brook-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=stony-brook-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.stonybrook.edu/undergraduate-admissions/visit/virtual-tour.php"}]},{"guid":"7536da26-9ded-418d-94b7-25d9d175e421","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":185,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":31.305264,"lon":-89.291815},"entity":{"abbreviation":"WCU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1907","ipeds":"176479"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7536da26-9ded-418d-94b7-25d9d175e421","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"HATTIESBURG, MS","name":"William Carey University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"504f2d2d-3311-42ae-9139-d246921002bf","gradSchool":"ba37d849-a3e2-4e6f-b534-dfcc4b518432","state":"278befb8-d5e0-43d2-bf87-cf6d95e438d2","town":"14b7f8d6-2b26-4dd5-bdcb-52c2a39bb87f","zipCode":"f6638d8b-a326-4447-ba5c-9143cc5c2d34"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"William Carey","tagline":["4 Year","HATTIESBURG, MS"],"type":"College","url":"william-carey-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5357833655705996},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":15271},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1050-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"William Carey is a solid choice if you’re looking for a smaller, faith-based university with a strong academic focus. The professors genuinely care about students, and the small class sizes make it easy to get help when you need it. The school is especially known for programs like nursing, education, and business.\n\nCampus life has a close-knit feel, so it’s easy to make connections with both classmates and faculty. While it’s not a big party school, there are still plenty of ways to get involved, whether through clubs, student organizations, or mission work. The Christian atmosphere is a big part of the school’s culture, so it’s a good fit if that’s something you value.\n\nThe facilities aren’t as fancy as those at bigger schools, but they’re well-kept and improving over time. One major plus is the affordability—Carey provides a quality education without the massive price tag.\n\nOverall, if you want a supportive, faith-centered college experience, William Carey is definitely worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-27T21:34:08.531233Z","guid":"f9d3ba49-722c-4aca-b26c-51e2c4a6f5d8","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/169a9b1d00fd7a7a546bb9afc6d902d65abf9c7b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8c83fb14e179b463908196ac8f69f27efa1a73f4","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/169a9b1d00fd7a7a546bb9afc6d902d65abf9c7b","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c3e39f806311856ecd91bab67ebabd73b99b6bb2"},"guid":"f72cf480-86c8-4394-b2d4-bb127bb36f96","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.291815,31.305264,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.291815,31.305264,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"89220bd1-79b5-4fc9-b10b-977d958556c6","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9038461538461537,"count":364},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.wmcarey.edu/admissions/undergraduate/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-carey-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=william-carey-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.wmcarey.edu/admissions/undergraduate/"}]},{"guid":"1d981220-ae87-42dd-8601-807c5884cfaf","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":186,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.041912,"lon":-118.707677},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Pepperdine","alternates":{"ceeb":"4630","ipeds":"121150"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"1d981220-ae87-42dd-8601-807c5884cfaf","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MALIBU, CA","name":"Pepperdine University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","gradSchool":"085972cc-3d57-4077-a900-4cc30e9cef12","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","zipCode":"a1a95ca8-152e-4d3d-a495-8582e78fa315"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Pepperdine","tagline":["4 Year","MALIBU, CA"],"type":"College","url":"pepperdine-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.48709227280655853},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":47804},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1280-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The campus is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking ocean views that make studying feel a little less stressful. The professors are highly knowledgeable and genuinely care about their students’ success, which makes a big difference in the learning environment.\n\nOne of the highlights for me has been the strong sense of community. Whether it’s through faith, Greek life, or campus events, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved and build meaningful relationships. The small class sizes also allow for a more personalized education, which I really appreciate.\n\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement. The cost of attendance is high, and while financial aid is available, it can still be a major burden. Parking is also a challenge, and more on-campus dining options would be a great addition.\n\nOverall, Pepperdine offers an incredible academic and social experience, especially if you take advantage of all the resources available.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T01:43:58.815114Z","guid":"6bed3ee5-79c8-41b9-ad68-44801cdae79b","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6310951933c94d69d7cd9844b81ad7938488dd68","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15460b02bcb2c9a29b717f4337eefd217213f4a7","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6310951933c94d69d7cd9844b81ad7938488dd68","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f49ec5c63c89e0be7782e7a841df586b89102ed4"},"guid":"7aba8dee-d266-471c-8b57-b9aa05acc109","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ab86b2c40030a6b50e755c519f14e04fadcf158f"},"guid":"bfc7c350-1718-4e29-8176-a48a42d24a0b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:06:43.203807Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.707677,34.041912,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.707677,34.041912,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"51f6c279-a228-460a-95a6-5840de386b9f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4319862992ec81bb1a769d78cf1fbda9019bcf6d","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f40d0f3354c0f81f11b291f38d164948b72ebbe9"},"guid":"14decd41-161e-41bc-b226-c3c65855c5c6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-18T17:44:20.94073Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7696709585121604,"count":1398},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/about/visit/campustours/video/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pepperdine-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=pepperdine-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/about/visit/campustours/video/"}]},{"guid":"2b3e0dea-5255-4fa4-af03-4a14bb5889f0","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":187,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.741997,"lon":-74.177113},"entity":{"abbreviation":"NJIT","alternates":{"ceeb":"2513","ipeds":"185828"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"2b3e0dea-5255-4fa4-af03-4a14bb5889f0","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEWARK, NJ","name":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"024bd7fb-e9aa-4c55-bce3-41fe90a7896f","gradSchool":"c2d22098-db30-4e43-9020-cc7a19f1fde8","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"e8c15175-446d-4459-9981-718c67dbb676","state":"ed4102c4-b16f-4ccd-8d8b-ccfeb8fa21ea","town":"53db3db1-f94b-4a7a-9b19-7c553832a893","zipCode":"c467f0b6-8521-4e44-bf76-983302ef4d0e"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"NJIT","tagline":["4 Year","NEWARK, NJ"],"type":"College","url":"new-jersey-institute-of-technology","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6598770176787087},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17762},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1190-1450"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This is a good school for those looking for hard work. The best teachers here are the ones who help push you forward but keep things challenging. Most professors are very understanding and reachable. You will be spending a lot of time studying and doing time-consuming homework. However, it is all to prepare you for the exams and finals. Put in the work and you will do just fine. There are many resources that help prepare students for the coursework. When you have free time, it can be spent in campus center game room or in club activities. There are many dining options in and around campus that are cheap. All the buildings are close to each other so getting to class is never complicated. However, traffic is a huge problem during the afternoon. Public transportation to NJIT via NJ Transit trains is an easy commute. You can travel as many times as you’d like with the student pass and it gives you access to buses and the Newark Light Rail. It’s a good experience, especially with friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-02T21:41:28.067308Z","guid":"5ef899a2-b5a9-4067-9233-a13c04403afe","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bd605ade72ec78c1daacec5f93c6995d9616f73b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b6503a3145cbc1feca6865615e6db5e3b03f01ce","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70cee87f7ee7faa6f7b9bf9d1b26c536fddbcd11","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2f6f13c8f6b62c51f90390ef32ec399cacc23ff7"},"guid":"c35cff3e-8adc-4c24-b495-54ddaefba13b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-04-06T17:36:59.674631Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2d05d870477b1cc1bedc771e721b665d154890b"},"guid":"827dd303-0699-4f47-aab3-be740a726ea5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-07T13:43:28.9913Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.177113,40.741997,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.177113,40.741997,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"827c535b-9bd4-4944-b984-d0f938d35955","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/33f2a844617a650d4a1269897ba0d908e33e9c6a","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/33f2a844617a650d4a1269897ba0d908e33e9c6a"},"guid":"29beba42-c46d-414e-bd64-f4c727b2c768","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.509259259259259,"count":1296},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://campus360.org/en/viewer?id=33"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/new-jersey-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=new-jersey-institute-of-technology"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://campus360.org/en/viewer?id=33"}]},{"guid":"5029c3cc-a7d0-44a8-ac6a-215575af1342","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":188,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.268742,"lon":-74.777412},"entity":{"abbreviation":"TCNJ","alternates":{"ceeb":"2519","ipeds":"187134"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"5029c3cc-a7d0-44a8-ac6a-215575af1342","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"EWING, NJ","name":"The College of New Jersey","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6c9953c4-b55c-49b7-90ae-6ecd61528343","gradSchool":"bc7fce1a-5d31-4799-b561-0f5b71e6547a","state":"ed4102c4-b16f-4ccd-8d8b-ccfeb8fa21ea","town":"704b53bb-8c8d-4b0e-845d-c87f2e51e638","zipCode":"9367e618-5047-4d56-8444-4304c61c6e17"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"TCNJ","tagline":["4 Year","EWING, NJ"],"type":"College","url":"the-college-of-new-jersey","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6443409046787032},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":22273},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have enjoyed my time at TCNJ.

The engineering department has a rigorous and exciting mechanical engineering program, though they have been understaffed during my time here which has led to some less-than-ideal situations in terms of professors and class times. Overall, I would recommend the school to people looking for a quiet and safe environment, and especially for students going into STEM majors, as it is a renowned school for technical majors and offers many opportunities for future careers.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-01T20:47:58.798253Z","guid":"f8278c8b-4bb9-4f52-a86a-12d0a9ea273a","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e6260786928af35f577b65da79000ce3dcf83873","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63cdf4140f6acd3712a7087be893f37a005969a3","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/80e9a856c54b259a5f755bee07d72b64840bbee2","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/de9c8ac23a3e2b5d0f6520460d782cd27514f16b"},"guid":"5d4c5e43-3f64-4421-b785-fe479d44021e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-11-01T16:30:35.24478Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ad829aa769027fafd6ca84f140e179293b05ce00"},"guid":"fdc9851f-6881-49f1-a2e4-72bef04631fd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.777412,40.268742,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.777412,40.268742,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"09db7372-3599-4d6e-91b6-78f6f850b2cc","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/36cfc509a2e1b4c062938fb40e1390e5fc63895e","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff70db0c5fe94df477545be7634ee411c22dc55f"},"guid":"9e828214-0c5e-4c21-81a0-1a3fb7b82da0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-24T14:32:11.474765Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7206427688504324,"count":1618},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://virtualtour.tcnj.edu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-college-of-new-jersey/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=the-college-of-new-jersey"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://virtualtour.tcnj.edu/"}]},{"guid":"7f446129-261e-4b1c-bc59-64e6c9572962","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":189,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":47.802021,"lon":-96.609863},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"U of M Crookston","alternates":{"ceeb":"6893","ipeds":"174075"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7f446129-261e-4b1c-bc59-64e6c9572962","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CROOKSTON, MN","name":"University of Minnesota Crookston","parentGUIDs":{"college":"0b83c6e9-e025-499b-8a0a-223f6e845cd7","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"5d0ef038-7576-4ccc-a399-1e9bea346dff","onlineChild":"7b4efe74-143e-46f4-ba25-591058caba1c","parent":"0b83c6e9-e025-499b-8a0a-223f6e845cd7","state":"534cd634-543d-4983-89c3-22323ac74f77","town":"3a3b5085-5bd7-4f94-877c-7e7ee8c38578","zipCode":"02e4e94c-9efc-416a-95a1-cbbcfca5786e"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"U of M Crookston","tagline":["4 Year","CROOKSTON, MN"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota-crookston","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5878499106611078},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12894},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1000-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Crookston staff and students are very welcoming and almost feels like a family after a while.

The engineering programs, including civil engineering, are well-structured with knowledgeable professors and strong research opportunities. The campus is large and well-equipped, featuring modern labs, libraries, and study spaces. One of UB’s biggest strengths is its affordability, offering high-quality education at a reasonable cost compared to other U.S. universities.\n\nUB provides great career services, networking, and student organizations. However, academic advising can feel impersonal, and course registration is competitive. Buffalo winters are harsh, so be prepared! The campus transportation system and administrative processes could also be improved. Despite this, UB offers strong academics, career opportunities, and a solid foundation for future success.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-29T18:47:55.89531Z","guid":"da28a0c2-e910-46a5-afa3-efc9f40571cc","helpfulness":2,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7fb535de3f1f101ee201e7edc37b4c597d0faf07","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/44af0284ab6382e200950bd63ca8fd207e51c11e","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20ba5d9f18f8ea95e479b5492494a0e30ea36903","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f392781f77001672f0ff73c3948c999fd6a3cb29"},"guid":"5ba61422-83e2-4a9e-a025-2303c5978a15","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-16T14:24:46.182455Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a8d698a9025848c21e52d4e64038cfdf539979e"},"guid":"cd428c8e-3655-4b06-a293-c36e81ee355e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-16T13:16:52.23361Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.790103,43.001433,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.790103,43.001433,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"48e5b183-dffc-4672-b916-6a3f3f5820bf","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6c5640600a2e465ef44d4a17c6f2d1cf2ca16aa5","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/110b7b1c62f783816b172b20be54a277e3c7d650"},"guid":"c6d9ae34-48f8-4749-83db-5cb7543db5ca","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-03-17T18:52:03.997159Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6588419405320813,"count":3195},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tours.fullmeasure.io/university-at-buffalo/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-at-buffalo-suny/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-at-buffalo-suny"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tours.fullmeasure.io/university-at-buffalo/"}]},{"guid":"5661693d-f152-4d12-b65f-f318532a03d5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":191,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.941662,"lon":-93.189422},"entity":{"abbreviation":"St. Thomas","alternates":{"ipeds":"174914"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"5661693d-f152-4d12-b65f-f318532a03d5","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"SAINT PAUL, MN","name":"University of St. Thomas - Minnesota","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"9300a4be-3cfa-41d1-b4ec-da53975b9679","gradSchool":"1cf02c12-8d5e-4167-b89e-ba8db8f8ac6c","metroArea":"b9517c86-f92e-4a8e-ac5f-e7530b9c2636","neighborhood":"21823d8d-6142-4023-8218-818afd0f49af","state":"534cd634-543d-4983-89c3-22323ac74f77","town":"75904604-cbcb-40a4-961c-4694af629157","zipCode":"88a8115d-45fd-4164-9727-7fc71a681de6"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"St. Thomas - Minnesota","tagline":["4 Year","SAINT PAUL, MN"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-st-thomas-minnesota","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7699609745807404},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":30137},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1200-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The Beauty of UST is that you can make your own experience, UST is big enough to meet different people and small enough to know your professors.

Food is good, I just wish we had dinning areas close to campus. St Thomas academics are rigorous and some classes are pretty fun! During my time here, my Catholic identity became stronger, we volunteer and help the community and attend to faith events. I did like the diversity and the opportunity to learn about other people and being in classrooms with people who have different view points and liven experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-10T17:58:13.97349Z","guid":"766201ec-0476-42df-b720-acf27f0c1439","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48f3061a2059715b3bfcd173255bc57f8acf33a1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/71520b22da3b20bcce58599c0a9bb39cc760c958.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48f3061a2059715b3bfcd173255bc57f8acf33a1.jpg"},"guid":"8dc85901-4c9d-418f-b53a-6cfb20d8c5eb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a4e4a7f2b74ea6dde23d695fbb515659cb1eb098"},"guid":"f224dcf5-b520-49d3-ac33-86bc55cdc7d7","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:15:54.263307Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.189422,44.941662,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.189422,44.941662,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c90919b5-e3d6-41b8-afbc-863634309dec","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f93a6d5c4ba5462292689b738b5e8321610417f9","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b82bb5c3c1542361d89dbad9519c91f742bdf7f8"},"guid":"d9287055-e690-4126-8681-368c1b6e99c9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T15:20:22.508993Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8565022421524664,"count":1338},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://vimeo.com/399925362/eac82cd34d"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas-minnesota/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-st-thomas-minnesota"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://vimeo.com/399925362/eac82cd34d"}]},{"guid":"3c1bba7d-a36d-493c-b74f-20b18c3c23df","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":192,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":31.5537741,"lon":-97.1209157},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Baylor","alternates":{"ceeb":"6032","ipeds":"223232"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"3c1bba7d-a36d-493c-b74f-20b18c3c23df","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"WACO, TX","name":"Baylor University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"1042dc84-5fe2-4cb1-ab85-1803a7f38df4","gradSchool":"fc462364-d1d6-41d6-bbac-9c92fb88eb54","metroArea":"c722c12c-4eab-446a-848e-386f6c677e43","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"d46f524d-9e04-4e96-8646-f67f4fff34de","zipCode":"9203b962-76dc-4f41-b2fd-e5dc633975f1"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Baylor","tagline":["4 Year","WACO, TX"],"type":"College","url":"baylor-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.45911501817110306},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":45988},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1230-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Baylor University is a top-tier institution known for academic excellence, strong Christian values, and a vibrant campus life.

Overall I am very happy to be here and am excited to continue my learning!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-04T23:35:22.281382Z","guid":"79c8ed06-1923-48d5-9434-242f4421200d","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f655d9c52bb1b7762c588b8c4c9e2767dd097e61","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0b5360d5da12d23d7fa6f2d2bea574e7e00ef041","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6f51de93603c2c553879c10902d28324456c708e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0899f2a97405a54d2a486d583bdc363f60097b95"},"guid":"32b735d9-199e-4ae2-b6e5-08517bae44fb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-22T19:15:48.345664Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2d225f7c35f780df73ee63898239aa55ae27338a"},"guid":"82b59e61-8634-433e-99d2-317a858d5220","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-25T15:18:33.064966Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.578039,39.035366,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.578039,39.035366,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d67bd2a5-4868-4e9e-a7fa-01d56f360024","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7293c5dc2060919e3d458bdd0e7c6c7515139033","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c946b41c883120966c496eee8440140e438c5cd2"},"guid":"c47bc1b6-4544-4054-818b-c6b09f320b69","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-25T17:30:33.917546Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6447823082239115,"count":1447},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/umkc"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri-kansas-city/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-missouri-kansas-city"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/umkc"}]},{"guid":"366832a5-05dd-47e7-9434-91ad1d86f859","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":198,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.0357557,"lon":-84.5056931},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UK","alternates":{"ceeb":"1837","ipeds":"157085"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"366832a5-05dd-47e7-9434-91ad1d86f859","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"LEXINGTON, KY","name":"University of Kentucky","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"24c74f82-6db3-43d2-b99c-7df4ad4a266e","gradSchool":"9a828a54-3bf3-4a1f-9da5-10023000a046","metroArea":"bff6a839-2b54-4c93-ae7c-b8f76dd2e56f","state":"27966205-db74-44e6-8d2d-79a4df61742a","town":"0cab6fee-38c9-4677-977b-ffa2b2677584","zipCode":"d7d5f6b4-1f1e-4a1a-91c3-258618c81c25"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Kentucky","tagline":["4 Year","LEXINGTON, KY"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-kentucky","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9492314008119327},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":18693},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1070-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Kentucky provided an incredible balance between academics and social life. I loved the energy on campus, especially during basketball season! There’s a real sense of school spirit that brings people together. Academically, the professors in the psychology department were supportive and passionate, always willing to help outside of class. I also enjoyed the William T. Young Library, which makes studying feel productive and comfortable. One thing I would have liked to see improve is parking. It can be frustrating to find spots near class buildings. Also, expanding mental health services on campus would be beneficial. More counselors and shorter wait times would help ensure students feel supported. Lastly, I’d love more diverse dining options, especially for late-night snacks or healthier options. Overall, I am having a positive experience and felt that UK gave me a solid foundation for my future","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-20T16:51:22.469748Z","guid":"7b862ca0-d79b-4760-848d-6b2407e3b9bb","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d5b3ef4d1931572510f546cf166ad0b3a37aac13","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f4ab6a50caf9ea57e0c0552c0431d9aeeca1061","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4d24294347fbf28636c3c9b10df9bfda17a1348e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c765f17bbdcca1eaaa87af90ba6f0e8fab9351f2"},"guid":"c614e6d1-50ad-4521-a4f2-3b900616d5bb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-06T19:44:18.126281Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/37f9ae3c570857ebe3bf8610a64d10d05306470c"},"guid":"c681c484-b467-45c3-82ff-db68dd8a374c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-04-21T14:57:02.7559Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.5056931,38.0357557,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.5056931,38.0357557,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d1352eaa-af67-41c6-a19d-036adc0eb491","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d4aca54bd51dee0d6d17a7d9d5d24cd6b83eb572","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2c88435097203e42d6ed31433708bd7bd1f3a1d3"},"guid":"0b535b83-3432-4576-89a3-4861d20b2fc5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-04-11T15:40:35.460451Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.76364522417154,"count":4104},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://visit.uky.edu/virtual-visit"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-kentucky/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-kentucky"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://visit.uky.edu/virtual-visit"}]},{"guid":"a7a9a143-f721-4c16-a66b-21f874e8da63","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":199,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.334565,"lon":-90.330452},"entity":{"abbreviation":"MC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1477","ipeds":"176053"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"a7a9a143-f721-4c16-a66b-21f874e8da63","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CLINTON, MS","name":"Mississippi College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"783c0e47-8ddb-4d04-8309-c5e5d2f63151","gradSchool":"e9d91013-dd6d-44ea-ae18-a1fd9d3cfc48","metroArea":"ecdb6fff-fb61-4da3-a3f7-5e9a4b4cff62","state":"278befb8-d5e0-43d2-bf87-cf6d95e438d2","town":"24543456-cd0e-4aed-91b0-094f230663fe","zipCode":"a1d645e5-026c-4181-a242-896d7e60a7a3"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"MC","tagline":["4 Year","CLINTON, MS"],"type":"College","url":"mississippi-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.3999171156237049},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20874},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Mississippi College!

I just love it here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-15T23:12:02.320631Z","guid":"e6bec36f-4df7-4a93-a4f4-93c31bb9e8a7","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f03f5534bf7fcf1f5d1a6c0bd12bff75aa4c8f7a","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/111e104b04246bce3a7d3bf449f99b69623ee94d","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7de75e2ea722fa82a7549e585eda9c96d9b86b74","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1755caf9f5036de100963a5e949e560b7bb36497"},"guid":"c44b90ca-bced-4590-80ac-2205e94a7e2d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-09-08T21:47:18.351581Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26e9f87644ef758df726b927f77ee7980750afd1"},"guid":"0382e10b-dc36-4cf8-b06e-62590d354096","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-13T17:26:02.694709Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.990622,40.491522,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.990622,40.491522,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d7f9c63e-e273-46a1-9fbe-61316abd0426","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6eb62652f5dcaa359831a32eed584f43f1a4b8ce","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e96d29728f573e62a89b6c5a1c742f7c67e329ec"},"guid":"3cd2c47f-78cd-4517-a10f-0e5269740c92","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-13T18:03:31.950446Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7448680351906156,"count":682},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.iwu.edu/map/?id=1177#!ct/30091,30092,30095,30101,30102?s/?t/2689:1?share"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/illinois-wesleyan-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=illinois-wesleyan-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.iwu.edu/map/?id=1177#!ct/30091,30092,30095,30101,30102?s/?t/2689:1?share"}]},{"guid":"91451c36-ddf8-4179-9ef1-2398f341386e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":201,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.937802,"lon":-77.090106},"entity":{"abbreviation":"AU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5007","ipeds":"131159"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"91451c36-ddf8-4179-9ef1-2398f341386e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WASHINGTON, DC","name":"American University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d73df838-83ae-47ca-82f0-0f68c06ac7c7","gradSchool":"9d98556e-886f-4fa1-be70-27e75663cb75","metroArea":"1cd9901c-6cda-4d97-a26e-e3b24e3f25cb","neighborhood":"51acef38-53f4-44d0-a750-0480fdb1eb5c","state":"d8812b16-d311-48fc-882d-56a7a6f186d4","town":"f88fc330-6f67-485b-b3a0-e2b37c14ca23","zipCode":"db450a0b-06e5-4a42-aafd-5a3bb3eb25ad"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"American","tagline":["4 Year","WASHINGTON, DC"],"type":"College","url":"american-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.40600535640708696},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":41369},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1290-1430"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a first-year Political Science major at American University, I’ve had an enriching experience. The location in Washington, D.C. offers invaluable opportunities for internships, networking, and real-world learning. Being close to political organizations and agencies has enhanced my academic journey. AU provides excellent networking events, connecting students with alumni and professionals in my field. The campus is beautiful, with modern facilities, green spaces, and great food options. However, as an Afro-Latina female student, I feel the campus could benefit from more cultural diversity. That said, the professors are supportive, and the community is welcoming. The faculty encourages critical thinking and academic growth, and I’ve felt supported in every aspect of my education. Overall, American University offers an ideal environment for both academic and professional growth, and I look forward to continuing my studies here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-19T20:10:41.766576Z","guid":"22bc83ab-3977-4792-be92-b0ff6ed5ce85","helpfulness":2,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c27085cd12b4e369f6a18f66c339adf788296d35","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a06d0fda151c2a39ca0103c01c644a289eaee21","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f02f5bd316b7162e1516daa1a99e0f5cff7ae6da","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2ccd41b0babf21a9fefb688173610a16649bdf1"},"guid":"ce3499f7-ed7e-40b2-b3f3-c542c7a1de04","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-09T20:43:13.675989Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ccdd8190da7e6b11613bfe81552092ba7dd67725"},"guid":"73efc559-51e0-4744-a7bc-d47d91cb58a2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-05-04T14:49:12.681742Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090106,38.937802,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090106,38.937802,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f316db1d-db24-44f2-9dbd-f2b452d886ae","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e74a0f7ac2f9adbeacdaa63892c6cf791ff2fd78","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2692faa757a880872d20cf5acb3074ca04f8407d"},"guid":"eb6e2518-0df1-4ff9-95fe-de5fc3f7dd41","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-18T18:56:00.111458Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.594241842610365,"count":2605},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://map-american.university-tour.com/au-main-campus#"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/american-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=american-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://map-american.university-tour.com/au-main-campus#"}]},{"guid":"7506bda8-994b-4e7a-a0b8-cbd64bed03bb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":202,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.817578,"lon":-73.928498},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Union","alternates":{"ipeds":"196866"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7506bda8-994b-4e7a-a0b8-cbd64bed03bb","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SCHENECTADY, NY","name":"Union College - New York","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d5f88c98-7f37-4579-815b-b16d85e68e6e","metroArea":"0126e2f4-1dd5-40d2-a2b3-46b4409d4872","neighborhood":"7ecef9f9-c0de-4d1b-9298-61a84117848a","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"7178151f-e266-416b-8f70-d0df071b49c6","zipCode":"457667f2-542b-477b-87ca-83607fe38862"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Union College","tagline":["4 Year","SCHENECTADY, NY"],"type":"College","url":"union-college-new-york","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.4651217781981556},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":41136},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1310-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I found Union on the hidden ivy list and was not aware of it until then.

The resources from UVA are extensive, and the community is wholesome. However, there are not many international students. The dorms, especially McCraray, are not great but not as bad as people say. Freshmen must stay in the dorms, and I am on the 3rd floor.\n\nThe student recreation team and wellness center organize many fun programs. However, the dorm and food are quite expensive for the location. As a vegetarian, I find the food options limited, and the cafeteria is not open 24 hours, which is inconvenient when I'm hungry late at night.\n\nFor student-athletes, this university is financially beneficial.

I would like to see less of a turnover with professors.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-06T20:57:59.784391Z","guid":"7df3b1db-d239-4895-9763-d21228b0c833","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/624042e567a0afe16138f7998776fb71ca7cf386","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fa2c35664d2350d957c10a80cd20f3205700050","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68293cd32b9e218bab7ec701158e18ba18e1babe","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50659ca81c937e924283fc1f30eeff5f0d597a56"},"guid":"d8e52e1c-8de1-4e0d-ae26-62da1d86dd61","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-17T20:16:00.167344Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2f9d4b37569cb60907017e36147626a847871085"},"guid":"0c8bb788-e2e7-495a-ac13-56aa61d6edc6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:32:51.239763Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.857636,33.678879,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.857636,33.678879,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"14aef08e-ee86-44cf-bee0-44567a80c641","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2045745d154684cf09ee8d242af76c4b9906383b","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e9b6421278f4dabd17840044d52cb72c6b1499b"},"guid":"4dc2392d-a7df-4d72-9e38-14fa7b94a0db","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.12280701754386,"count":114},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/stanbridge?pl=v"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/stanbridge-university-orange-county/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=stanbridge-university-orange-county"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/stanbridge?pl=v"}]},{"guid":"02e8c17e-d644-4a0d-b426-f4c9b43067bd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":215,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.980943,"lon":-75.158267},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Temple","alternates":{"ceeb":"2906","ipeds":"216339"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"02e8c17e-d644-4a0d-b426-f4c9b43067bd","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"PHILADELPHIA, PA","name":"Temple University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"58db4be1-4d78-44f5-aa68-1f486cd6f05e","gradSchool":"22c1c491-8b59-48b5-ba4b-8687cd95e44e","metroArea":"dbdec0e2-fa77-4d1e-9fa2-346eec4a8132","neighborhood":"9b705da7-82aa-4a1c-a02b-c067ff4daa42","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"f348a217-d5b6-4bec-91be-79a57bc282c1","zipCode":"055702c6-d579-4079-b6ff-73bdd98fda35"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Temple","tagline":["4 Year","PHILADELPHIA, PA"],"type":"College","url":"temple-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7970051207779445},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":23935},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1010-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I like how the professor is willing to help you and provide feedback to improve your understanding of the material you're learning.

The professor suggested I visit the writing center, but they were very slow in editing my work. However, other classes are fun, and I'm learning in a very enjoyable way.

While SLU provides a supportive and enriching environment, addressing these concerns could make the experience even better for students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-06T21:37:35.691207Z","guid":"5d947ab8-9b53-4bbc-b2be-3cfc24205d77","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ace93cd9db596496b7dbc6b2c49d622034722ce","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/08d728ba61c5eac7a5326e87f01d3a76f1bbf071","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3b98e94bacd16d9b56efc2dd8f425774787a0e7a","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/097e8c2c2c33b6541ceab60625c04cbdf8f15f2a"},"guid":"265398ec-577e-46f1-b225-0a709493b119","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-08-08T18:32:33.026488Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cb6f4b1cba1daa8025863dac1f0b49f46d5b4e9"},"guid":"cf2cc04f-cff1-4556-835c-a1560c713a0d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-18T16:27:04.00252Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.2337426,38.6338834,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.2337426,38.6338834,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"db067411-eb94-423f-abb8-1968e27ec512","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7e021ad4459b5ae8f1a3ad128c4a167cf89cfb60","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2b7b419dbf50d36e4ccc5627100393a0b409afb2"},"guid":"aaf798d1-9973-4186-9272-eee69356ffac","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-18T19:00:08.362007Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6735704637550652,"count":2221},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/slu"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-louis-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=saint-louis-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/slu"}]},{"guid":"7e0ed7cc-6f4f-4459-93a3-a3c4389e19ef","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":218,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.4400229,"lon":-78.8716115},"entity":{"abbreviation":"JMU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5392","ipeds":"232423"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7e0ed7cc-6f4f-4459-93a3-a3c4389e19ef","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"HARRISONBURG, VA","name":"James Madison University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e1fb4844-f5f5-4f13-a343-00c680823489","gradSchool":"9a58f3cb-9575-41f2-8062-a9ed5a86a80f","state":"4feeaf03-3715-4319-bdb1-619871879d68","town":"a9e2632b-593c-4967-8d41-959de6a43a8b","zipCode":"c625a6f3-2a1b-4d16-aa7b-c6f907990032"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"James Madison","tagline":["4 Year","HARRISONBURG, VA"],"type":"College","url":"james-madison-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7830204081632653},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":18274},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"From the moment I arrived at James Madison University, I knew I’d found my home.

Overall, I am honored to be part of the Florida Tech community and excited about the journey ahead!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-27T10:53:29.055479Z","guid":"9a3575c9-a535-45e8-983e-758d4c866134","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0705aee8f8b51ea69157e6c74c149a6ff8dc9060","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d65f4840742fb54a77eface031a20f10db19b21b","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c72fa0b0b9bc3939d8ef99a5d7dddb65a9131d9d","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f96007621a1665a379663fd9f73be9183c3aab88"},"guid":"a6d5cb00-1eec-40e1-93f5-493588355129","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-20T15:31:17.803809Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5d221a74108f7e8715094a5e566124a981a3a7fd"},"guid":"e9ab9be5-1b7f-4c88-b5e8-b22c83112330","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-13T15:31:21.01761Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.624628,28.064503,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.624628,28.064503,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"87865a09-fd89-4c74-87b3-9fd03552f8bb","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2672fd648b9b19b14759d0e8dee99db1b5a1ca9","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4352b531ab30917d003124c369e2835c075d6f9c"},"guid":"495a91fd-b802-40a2-85b1-d26aa559bef6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-21T09:59:38.261257Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.751531058617673,"count":1143},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq2-6BaXx_0"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=florida-institute-of-technology"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq2-6BaXx_0"}]},{"guid":"c581a415-c253-4439-9568-cd46bc32427f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":222,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":37.790644,"lon":-79.435737},"entity":{"abbreviation":"VMI","alternates":{"ceeb":"5858","ipeds":"234085"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"c581a415-c253-4439-9568-cd46bc32427f","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"LEXINGTON, VA","name":"Virginia Military Institute","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"48ef245f-ca23-4cb2-af10-c968a85b270a","state":"4feeaf03-3715-4319-bdb1-619871879d68","town":"de78210c-03a8-4114-8d84-06d2671a67db","zipCode":"946e8220-65e0-4191-b456-a55d230ec315"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"VMI","tagline":["4 Year","LEXINGTON, VA"],"type":"College","url":"virginia-military-institute","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7115222876366695},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":18129},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1100-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Virginia Military Institute (VMI) excels in fostering discipline, leadership, and academic excellence.

I learned a lot from my professors because they were professionals in their field and were very knowledgeable of the subject material. I made great lifelong friends and the campus is beautiful and close to the city/beach. I live off-campus and it was the best decision I ever made. I thought about transferring my freshmen year, but I am glad I stayed because I have had an amazing four years here and wouldn't trade it for the world. I wish I had more time here! One thing I would like to see change is for expansion in their athletic facilities like the Rec Plex, there is simply not enough space for the amount of students they are accepting and I had to get a membership to a gym off-campus because it got so bad. Also, possibly another dining hall could go a long way because I know it gets crowded in there and it is difficult to find a seat just to eat my meals.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-28T18:01:45.39202Z","guid":"ec979d8c-40f7-40ce-a96f-deaeca0065cc","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/05fc575558f783e50c0f310c0e1e7fd38f37ca0f","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b3f8d3235ece7a5e1eece92e01b239dd96c57cf2","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c356ffff2d54fb55fdf6ad39ad43bce106352c2e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0d156a27a9e4db618a9f54dfa06200596d9b0f0"},"guid":"75670c91-8d79-4a46-8a92-3cb1964a67e1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-06T19:25:41.859506Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/83236763779c7c771936a33c704efb7315652ff5"},"guid":"115f2cf9-da15-497b-b3b1-45acce3c25ec","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-26T17:12:50.75922Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.25778,41.160732,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.25778,41.160732,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3934dde4-1f55-4913-861f-369765883f4d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f3849a28211b674ea1a563cf6e32dc1649dea5f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/687acc585bfddec4898b77164aa84ee5e5ec3414"},"guid":"6527f0ef-ca56-43e7-ae4c-9e5d9d49582d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-23T13:27:11.776885Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.628162816281628,"count":909},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/Z9BA9KZC-/stop/1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fairfield-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=fairfield-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/Z9BA9KZC-/stop/1"}]},{"guid":"53a1a524-ef97-4f51-a310-1af4a50f05b0","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":230,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.154424,"lon":-89.989187},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Rhodes","alternates":{"ceeb":"1730","ipeds":"221351"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"53a1a524-ef97-4f51-a310-1af4a50f05b0","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MEMPHIS, TN","name":"Rhodes College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"efc6fa92-f05b-42c5-9ab5-193966da489c","gradSchool":"fb53df0f-e568-4575-9903-c7bf1d6a148c","metroArea":"9a9fa214-34e9-41e2-83fe-a6fbba1dfb49","state":"eb2a19be-aace-48f2-9508-e8ed89070367","town":"52bd268a-cc58-4b1c-8d25-219baeec36d1","zipCode":"d15b4a58-bbc7-4bcc-b9bc-0dc495dac1b9"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Rhodes","tagline":["4 Year","MEMPHIS, TN"],"type":"College","url":"rhodes-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5401923076923076},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":30672},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1310-1470"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am honestly loving Rhodes, I was pretty apprehensive going into college however as I adjusted I realized how much I loved it!

But, I couldn't afford to take out more loans. USM took a chance on me, gave me full funding, and allowed me to teach two courses every semester. My life was in shambles before USM. I had no direction, no money, no prospects for a wife/kids. After USM, things fell in to place. I'm forever grateful for USM!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-02T14:32:54.676988Z","guid":"7ac819ba-d4ed-4c09-8765-e0272176221e","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d11c7963-ed18-4121-ab1a-62c73a82a78e","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.805672268907563,"count":1904},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-mississippi/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-southern-mississippi"}]},{"guid":"6b210cde-af44-44f1-8bf1-1ed4dc473d82","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":236,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":26.081502,"lon":-80.2480494},"entity":{"abbreviation":"NSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5514","ipeds":"136215"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6b210cde-af44-44f1-8bf1-1ed4dc473d82","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"FORT LAUDERDALE, FL","name":"Nova Southeastern University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"40555a7e-c93c-4e3e-8bc1-24f3a1ef887e","gradSchool":"63e6a514-a9b0-427f-9d8e-5ec0b5916811","metroArea":"05c150aa-2b84-4e19-a6e6-c57045e43d8b","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","town":"a733d40a-824f-4f27-84dc-a78bce122c02","zipCode":"793ee035-f8fb-4f0b-8422-9ba103e9e5f6"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"NSU Florida","tagline":["4 Year","FORT LAUDERDALE, FL"],"type":"College","url":"nova-southeastern-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7577319587628866},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":29589},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1040-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"Nova Southeastern University (NSU) has a lot to offer!

I got to know all of my professors and have time to speak to all of them even in slightly \"bigger\" classes.  There are so many fun events going on and clubs for almost anything! The area is amazing. I love Orange Circle and your close to all the SoCal stuff. Everyone also seems very willing to learn! If you want a \"smaller\" college and that southern California weather, this would be a perfect fit.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-18T21:23:17.133259Z","guid":"ea05c4b1-3ce0-4f58-b369-4f1e5b6c72fa","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6e1c729638bd11319a6b28e971a322759a8f9a89","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/de73f45e6d16e1d3a6edc5b21dca38c2382681d9","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6e1c729638bd11319a6b28e971a322759a8f9a89","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a04cfaf880af53a0e255fca62fb2ad81287f4fec"},"guid":"03cb9d77-bfb7-4735-bc4d-14be5b8033a8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c894101130eabade3f3d280437fd53c1390b37bd"},"guid":"9fc97ad0-4a23-43f6-8107-dc33286cc714","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-22T17:46:57.531078Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.853,33.7933,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.853,33.7933,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"aeea544e-5423-41c1-b83d-00dd40aaee79","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fc05031019072ff2589da01ff4f894686e7f1246","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9398e5e35b5ad0f82869f3e662966893cc15a9c3"},"guid":"382cf79a-0985-4f5d-bbc6-22f270661f72","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-22T17:52:42.766775Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.71220556745182,"count":2335},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/chapman/143029"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/chapman-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=chapman-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/chapman/143029"}]},{"guid":"dd79308c-7ca1-49de-ad76-6957be74628a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":240,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.873928,"lon":-73.894627},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Lehman","alternates":{"ceeb":"2844","ipeds":"190637"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"dd79308c-7ca1-49de-ad76-6957be74628a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"BRONX, NY","name":"Lehman College - City University of New York (CUNY)","parentGUIDs":{"college":"c88dd48f-ca5b-469b-8a13-69f0a1e89600","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ae856c91-1330-4738-bcbe-16ee6f5c93ed","gradSchool":"a9444a18-7431-46df-ac4d-39aa7286bbe0","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"1f6db287-d857-4e12-a6dd-ec0d1027da2b","parent":"c88dd48f-ca5b-469b-8a13-69f0a1e89600","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"59bf7f26-210b-419a-896c-0126c96acbdf","zipCode":"d25c3568-9396-403b-827c-a491eb72686e"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Lehman College","tagline":["4 Year","BRONX, NY"],"type":"College","url":"lehman-college-city-university-of-new-york-cuny","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5535562418871134},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":4974},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Lehman College is a humble, diverse, safe environment that provides their students with opportunities to excel and achieve their dreams.

Ouachita makes it a priority that new students feel welcomed and at home with the events they plan at the beginning of the school year. Although it is a baptist university, there is plenty of freedom to be yourself while still being pushed towards a life that honors Christ. The campus is beautiful.

In general, Conn is a place that values community rather than cut-throat competition among students. As a result, it attracts well-rounded, intellectually curious, globally responsible students who know they will have great opportunities to explore their interests at Conn. The faculty have always been top-notch, the campus is beautiful and right-sized and the athletics are excellent as Conn competes in the NEPSAC - the premier academic and D3 athletic conference.

Administration is extremely iffy. The registrar was late transferring classes, so I ended up having to take multiple courses that I'd already taken equivalents of through dual enrollment. I also had trouble with some of my outside scholarships. Finally, I must mention the mail room lest I forget what a dumpster fire it is. Most of the people here are kind and want to see you succeed, especially the professors. Coming in, I was nervous since my social life in high school wasn't great, but I've made so many friends already! Not much to do in town, but easy access to Chicago offers great opportunities for education and fun. Food is decent, but options are severely limited on weekends. I've enjoyed my time in the residence halls as well, though we've had some trouble with water heating, etc. If you get into a higher ranked school, go there, but if you get amazing financial aid like me, or this is your best option, LFC isn't a bad place to be at all.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-03T18:20:36.341018Z","guid":"00c43b35-e9d6-40c6-9ec0-1fad902152a7","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a88ea2d65ce62d42fe5b6228cd679ca8b5f76210","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1451b9491e7690af05c07ffa0c8cf162d412816c","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/71a4039b07ba165aa016f276873cc7810313240f","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4266bdddb47962b15085eb3fea2ce1d5bb86e277"},"guid":"cc56bbc5-ae9e-4931-ba43-fa6d7da748c3","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-01-02T20:16:27.45567Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/25a50928a11f12f4405c5639aac6cb151dfc2384"},"guid":"bd71d6a4-cf59-451e-a6ba-63ce9d989fcb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T20:33:20.673255Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d642d188-84a3-4b3e-9a24-53a601563482","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/88e904092541e5f8187618442bb685a660bf6424","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/88e904092541e5f8187618442bb685a660bf6424"},"guid":"33ad479e-8bc7-4de3-b0dc-2c10a5f77b9a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5258964143426295,"count":502},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.campusreel.org/colleges/lake-forest-college/vr"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lake-forest-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=lake-forest-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.campusreel.org/colleges/lake-forest-college/vr"}]},{"guid":"afcf0165-f552-4e44-8863-02c9c8d5f4e7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":245,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.652559,"lon":-73.778132},"entity":{"abbreviation":"ACPHS","alternates":{"ipeds":"188526"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"afcf0165-f552-4e44-8863-02c9c8d5f4e7","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"ALBANY, NY","name":"Albany College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ffbf878f-bb5e-4ca7-b03a-f9e6e21180b3","gradSchool":"866beff0-05ae-4663-b529-adf0f92d1e9a","metroArea":"0126e2f4-1dd5-40d2-a2b3-46b4409d4872","neighborhood":"ab58a24b-df18-4669-a202-f39eb18ea3af","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"cab45cb2-559a-4200-9741-dbe8d9b23d93","zipCode":"ae2c5c5b-727a-423c-a7ea-b102427b58b2"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"ACPHS","tagline":["4 Year","ALBANY, NY"],"type":"College","url":"albany-college-of-pharmacy-and-health-sciences","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6629103380695738},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":29175},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1220-1470"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My personal experience at Albany College of Pharmacy & Health Science has so far been a positive one.

It is a good college due to its small size but wide range of majors and the presence of a vibrant campus community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-18T21:07:38.573782Z","guid":"c9ee9f64-5189-42a6-be2c-e0b4536ac78c","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/31ed2eef28d291828982177ed82806277d2950d3","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f15b9bb4cfac9a07abcd2df164bbaffd63a5a14","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/65cadaeab8eee97a460cbdd00211b37cf9fd0ee1","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2d41e186bdf1b297cb4bdd6aaf8d9b4b71aa4e70"},"guid":"7e14ca75-06f0-4c80-b622-35d49a300d63","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-26T18:37:29.410919Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0e8d30af7f501386f7de2113e22d3f6e8271588f"},"guid":"8060e0ad-6ada-4a2e-8985-255e8f768e89","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-19T13:26:23.602009Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.10403819999999,42.7887516,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.10403819999999,42.7887516,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e968fae3-8975-4a23-a48e-e15c79bc950b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ddc037da12c50538916821d4b21e4d01037aef28","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48295b96e2e6be2139cfeb017ecc7458e3585db5"},"guid":"f9c93e63-7afc-4b1a-8b28-dc24d51c48bd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-11T15:06:52.952344Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.818827708703375,"count":1126},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youtu.be/39R_MVT2j4s"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hope-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=hope-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youtu.be/39R_MVT2j4s"}]},{"guid":"b9be9f9b-9415-49a6-990c-febf24814572","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":248,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.722818,"lon":-86.63842},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UAH","alternates":{"ceeb":"1854","ipeds":"100706"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b9be9f9b-9415-49a6-990c-febf24814572","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"HUNTSVILLE, AL","name":"The University of Alabama in Huntsville","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c71b1b9c-e4dc-419b-91c1-8d1e126f37cf","gradSchool":"3cf0ea90-ecbe-4400-9c14-e21d73ab644a","metroArea":"bf741fbd-288c-47f8-8218-90536d4fa4ec","state":"bcace3a7-dc8b-437b-a107-4499869a449a","town":"20cc4b41-5d5a-439e-8c30-7c42b10e1ce2","zipCode":"4965b9da-fbca-4b1b-8854-9b3b5462cfa0"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"The University of Alabama in Huntsville","tagline":["4 Year","HUNTSVILLE, AL"],"type":"College","url":"the-university-of-alabama-in-huntsville","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7810428238666905},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":18588},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1170-1430"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) stands out as a top-ranked institution, particularly in business education.

I came into college not knowing exactly what I wanted to do with my life; all I wanted to do was enjoy life in southern Louisiana and go to football games. And while I have in fact enjoyed southern Louisiana life and have been well-immersed with the student section at games, I have also had my path completely set for me to follow and thrive on through LSU. LSU's wonderful blend of helpful academic resources, never-ending campus life fun and bountiful extracurricular opportunities has transformed me into a Tiger that has a wonderful community circle to lean on, an on-campus job that I love and is flexible, an internship I got with the help of other LSU resources, and most importantly a career path that I am very excited to continue on. And I'm only a sophomore! I am so thankful for this place.\n\nI really do love it here. There is something for you at LSU, no matter what your background is.

The people responsible for handling the dorms, shoveling & salting the sidewalks, and mowing the lawns don't do a great job. The employees in public safety are rude. There is not nearly enough parking. The cost of tution goes up yearly with not enough aid given to current students, if any at all.

From my first day, I felt welcomed by a diverse community that values different cultures. The supportive faculty genuinely invest in students, providing invaluable mentorship and guidance.\n\nThe emphasis on experiential learning has allowed me to engage in hands-on projects, such as volunteering with a nonprofit that provides educational resources to underprivileged youth. This reinforced my belief in education as a tool for social change.\n\nHowever, I would like to see more support for international and DACA students, such as resources for cultural adaptation and career development. Increasing interdisciplinary collaboration between departments would also enhance learning.\n\nOverall, George Mason has positively impacted my growth, but additional support for marginalized groups would make it even better. I look forward to contributing to its inclusive community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-31T04:08:01.401996Z","guid":"7c59203f-5c2a-428f-bf7a-cbb7c8462d36","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9da97b419bbe42e50024a73e91ab21e7aa4c7360","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48816c14db0811a1093b745660d2936b8fc7e684","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/623433fe4fdf76a36116ada95c232f20f56794e9","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bab99fe539dd495fb5eb87f55633990cedb70f18"},"guid":"fd97b3e3-9f74-46d2-903e-e5d8703c0360","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-04T18:56:30.256304Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/31368e4a6f2b195583a26d3571be9da8203cea81"},"guid":"7d3de63c-e679-4c94-ae2e-6c126423321c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-01T23:16:42.837137Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.30794,38.83088,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.30794,38.83088,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"506cd18a-6deb-45c0-848c-2dc9772059e2","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6974db3bd0a6ce5d341667544d2d0ea666052ba7","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/54a070eefdce457fd37cf4cdf555ea80e4473e47"},"guid":"cab23684-90ea-49e7-8503-0d52c85fc047","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-01T22:44:07.310178Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.721890067502411,"count":5185},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/gmu/80651?pl=v&m_prompt=1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/george-mason-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=george-mason-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/gmu/80651?pl=v&m_prompt=1"}]},{"guid":"0de4b9ec-961d-4915-8869-7496b5688f15","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":253,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.090325,"lon":-77.67521},"entity":{"abbreviation":"RIT","alternates":{"ceeb":"2760","ipeds":"195003"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"0de4b9ec-961d-4915-8869-7496b5688f15","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"ROCHESTER, NY","name":"Rochester Institute of Technology","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"45c9e642-220f-4d43-8a30-0a7d6dc137da","gradSchool":"434753be-0cdb-4444-9531-b25d7ea9b2b0","metroArea":"7b63a960-2ac3-48c5-889d-0034a465d801","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"4a866fbb-db3c-4971-82ee-d73457b12f5f","zipCode":"099aea56-5025-4ee0-8b85-c2b1175bb1dc"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"RIT","tagline":["4 Year","ROCHESTER, NY"],"type":"College","url":"rochester-institute-of-technology","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6716859931592558},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":39600},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1270-1450"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"RIT College of Art and Design is one of the top schools for my major, and it shows.

I am only a sophomore, but my time here has been thrilling. I have had many opportunities to network, take opportunities, and have the \"college experience\". Being a part of a Greek Organization has helped me take on leadership roles and feel more confident in myself. My program is ASLIS and I love how I have close relationships with my cohort and professors. One thing I would like to see change is the meal-plan options for students. Prices for meal plans are astounding, but yet do not provide many options for students to eat. There are predominantly fast-food options and slim options on healthier choices for students. Moreover, the meal plans do not entirely consider what students need and do not have a diverse range to fit the majority of students. If the University could consider making changes to their meal plans and options on campus, I think it would help every student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-08T00:14:10.290708Z","guid":"d39b7fae-3998-46dd-a9b3-9cad61f06c94","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.7614322,38.2157954,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.7614322,38.2157954,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"0d156aa3-a235-42b1-8ecd-fdd72a1b1496","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.711892112791173,"count":2447},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-louisville/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-louisville"}]},{"guid":"1d82d046-ae89-4750-92ef-06f75376f8b3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":256,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.829731,"lon":-83.651042},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Mercer","alternates":{"ceeb":"5409","ipeds":"140447"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"1d82d046-ae89-4750-92ef-06f75376f8b3","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"MACON, GA","name":"Mercer University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"4764b180-0703-4899-9709-6cb1eb75d8d0","gradSchool":"eaa926bd-2cc0-4aa8-a612-510efca2f48b","metroArea":"d67b1b9a-d9fc-4f63-a676-d67457ed34b4","state":"2db170c0-259a-4537-ae3e-920d51841b7e","town":"483aaf21-a396-4a41-bc7f-5623e208dc0b","zipCode":"a5c5a812-c97a-4da4-bec5-56210e9f2186"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Mercer","tagline":["4 Year","MACON, GA"],"type":"College","url":"mercer-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7468237162519852},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":22087},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1190-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Other","body":"Mercer University is a standout institution known for its strong academic programs, dedicated faculty, and personalized learning environment.

Through it all, UNC Charlotte has pushed me to grow academically , professionally , and personally.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-24T23:55:52.525178Z","guid":"e0de5170-8eeb-43e5-9994-a7f105a5ff7d","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e955c944b702b7971f0756346ff49bfe89955aa3","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/343b5969b67169c189741eda101141b1f8fba09f","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb6e55bdaba0b827183b037cd3c649320a12843b","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20d45f625cc756a43b7b4f2007a549f67b5880c8"},"guid":"f30369fc-4e3f-451f-bd14-cfbcb6a9f96d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-03T15:22:38.409281Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7efe095f79c392b5a889897c6136ae92d46a0db0"},"guid":"b536f1d4-1100-4b16-96d2-f3d471393985","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-03T15:37:57.966014Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.73579,35.306834,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.73579,35.306834,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"51166a74-4fbb-4027-bf2d-7ae25e6c30ea","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/053799911c4a084def632d98f6490ff95539711c","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b13764e242e2d908e3c1407acfea6d8d95ac0aba"},"guid":"6a0e4009-4714-4814-b950-94ad1db3d166","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-03T15:35:36.586689Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7891832229580573,"count":3624},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://virtualtour.charlotte.edu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-at-charlotte/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-north-carolina-at-charlotte"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://virtualtour.charlotte.edu/"}]},{"guid":"62ff4962-72ad-4b5d-96f0-bd5ccd0ad1f7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":260,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":26.464262,"lon":-81.773578},"entity":{"abbreviation":"FGCU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5221","ipeds":"433660"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"62ff4962-72ad-4b5d-96f0-bd5ccd0ad1f7","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"FORT MYERS, FL","name":"Florida Gulf Coast University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"fc3f4b53-3556-4a1e-9c34-9505ca6730de","gradSchool":"be69618a-fa0d-4646-acad-a7fc0a7c4fcd","parent":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","zipCode":"09d9e98c-1204-43ad-ad89-f4e218a950bb"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Florida Gulf Coast","tagline":["4 Year","FORT MYERS, FL"],"type":"College","url":"florida-gulf-coast-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7449312440038376},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10834},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1040-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The housing is great with having your own room for almost every selection of on campus housing.

The faculty are knowledgeable and genuinely invested in helping students reach their full potential. Small class sizes in many programs allow for meaningful interactions, and the resources available—whether through academic advising, career services, or state-of-the-art facilities—make it easy for students to succeed. Beyond the classroom, NDSU fosters a culture of innovation and critical thinking. If there’s anything I could say that’s been personally challenging, it has nothing to do with the quality of the education or the school itself. Rather, it’s the natural adjustment that comes with being away from home. That’s a personal experience rather than a reflection on NDSU, which continues to provide an excellent education and a supportive community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-20T04:55:39.494042Z","guid":"035c5bfe-30e1-4efe-91ff-6a7f0a1bede6","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca88f6573c93baca8bd3ab68bc35493e722b0ceb","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ebe0235a06e019134053b5db9e8bd509fe71e120","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b69fcb3df2c32a8d08b9425d54dc6e06cbe6cdf2","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f82b036a42399fce16dc6e5ffa46d9ff8185c4c3"},"guid":"797da81f-e30e-4270-b774-7f13e17d466b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-19T19:42:31.771872Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fcdd8584ca6b47461886fccd747a71aaac05de1c"},"guid":"e434f916-7252-4837-848e-2a542636b014","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.805689,46.894523,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.805689,46.894523,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f7e2aa65-e28d-406b-ad28-67bb1a8edf27","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/35a434def6d27dae1d60114ef686051850a043a4","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f26a2feb7446d6de85be0a826a5e51980a9fb14b"},"guid":"88412454-bef1-41a0-a666-3e74fb748c2c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-01T18:43:50.709056Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8038490007401924,"count":1351},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://massinteract.com/north-dakota-state-university/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-dakota-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=north-dakota-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://massinteract.com/north-dakota-state-university/"}]},{"guid":"d1930e3f-f960-472f-969c-f9333da1eef4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":262,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.740238,"lon":-73.983417},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Baruch","alternates":{"ceeb":"2034","ipeds":"190512"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d1930e3f-f960-472f-969c-f9333da1eef4","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"NEW YORK, NY","name":"CUNY Baruch College","parentGUIDs":{"college":"c88dd48f-ca5b-469b-8a13-69f0a1e89600","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"510ffa3e-a740-4fc0-9626-13343de3d1f0","gradSchool":"c633ca60-c094-4414-9272-0317a3368f3d","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"d0c071aa-695c-444c-bcde-02c5b4d5d8e5","parent":"c88dd48f-ca5b-469b-8a13-69f0a1e89600","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"be4375aa-a7b8-433d-9864-a8f40bc9dcc1","zipCode":"80575009-953d-4d55-861f-a948f0d207be"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Baruch College","tagline":["4 Year","NEW YORK, NY"],"type":"College","url":"cuny-baruch-college","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.4959753047827446},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":4991},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1170-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at Baruch College so far has been fantastic!

Also, if you don't have a car, you can feel a little trapped in a small campus that resides in a small town.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-14T07:04:46.31094Z","guid":"ebef0540-ea09-4c6f-8b44-4b3a81f68e18","helpfulness":3,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8eb8a53867fb867ba1e6db2038af86a850e3f698","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/88c13a1f29082b526d7f762bc8cc0b21fe9168cf","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3339cfc73d4730f925a5529034f426866bbff48c","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aa5a2c49731e0f942fcd07f3f2ec6c54da83ae0a"},"guid":"b38ae0ad-cfea-4a80-8d35-82ce49469d82","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-13T23:23:30.671175Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a642e71978be9c3bfe2ac87d5647a94cc63b47a"},"guid":"c1bfca93-5efb-4b7c-977a-c8885ecf5cd1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-13T23:23:08.253466Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.33016,46.07135,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.33016,46.07135,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"1cfb90fc-ca1c-47b3-8935-f2c3959672fd","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3daebeb46cfb17740aa2457bbfa06888c1615341","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/293ac4916e083374228427be0849d012496f6345"},"guid":"7864f330-9164-46f5-bb10-5af4b537a7ef","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-03T21:40:02.947333Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.964788732394366,"count":426},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.whitman.edu/admission-and-aid/virtual-tours"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/whitman-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=whitman-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.whitman.edu/admission-and-aid/virtual-tours"}]},{"guid":"fcabf020-a103-45ce-a193-31c1c78584b3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":264,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.0231719,"lon":-75.1942263},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Jefferson","alternates":{"ceeb":"2903","ipeds":"216366"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"fcabf020-a103-45ce-a193-31c1c78584b3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PHILADELPHIA, PA","name":"Thomas Jefferson University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"58db4be1-4d78-44f5-aa68-1f486cd6f05e","gradSchool":"9ea089d9-a09f-4fa5-9a43-78bdb6f9c71b","metroArea":"dbdec0e2-fa77-4d1e-9fa2-346eec4a8132","neighborhood":"3f4806d5-e497-42d1-bc56-099979e95f31","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"f348a217-d5b6-4bec-91be-79a57bc282c1","zipCode":"8d8a5db9-5249-43a9-b89c-78453f423f64"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Jefferson","tagline":["4 Year","PHILADELPHIA, PA"],"type":"College","url":"thomas-jefferson-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8883818883818884},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":28110},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1130-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My time at Thomas Jefferson University’s College of Nursing was outstanding.

The school is also aware that college can be a stressful experience. To relieve some of this stress the school hosts multiple stress relief events, workshops, and student counselling services. I enjoy the community at UMSL and the help that everyone is willing to provide. One change I would like to see is healthier eating options. Currently the school's main food output is fast food, but they also provide healthy option such as rice bowls, salads, soups, sushi, and sandwiches.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-09T18:20:40.073274Z","guid":"3a8a8567-fd89-4891-bbe7-a23a864e6d81","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9507db448b39fac72e67d717d12194ff4596a247","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8d8a61f1229d8b2194387a11d14e2c0d38994071","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f3b31a61188afdfb2bf1c61349918dcfcc206963","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/912393279b8b57f0512db9032f8e730a68764781"},"guid":"3c8bf273-88cf-40d0-9b33-76e8221ca307","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-09-28T19:19:43.376717Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/46c7e2f397f4ccad760c39cb145df1ac7c8f1b74"},"guid":"8fa490e0-37a1-46fc-828c-9b2a0ad9ce85","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:06:25.803065Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3cf035d1-82cb-4993-898a-1bb638a9fb5b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/183aa7a3d15cac425d4d6cdc1d7b77b0317e196e","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/39a5967352f7c4ff2bd104d673bbdaef09e91fb6"},"guid":"8d284e24-8d7b-4916-ad56-5e9337ea0670","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-02-16T16:43:01.245436Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.587958607714017,"count":1063},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missourist-louis/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-missourist-louis"}]},{"guid":"14315b39-88dc-4f53-842d-76f0b7835d56","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":268,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.050705,"lon":-95.954215},"entity":{"abbreviation":"ORU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6552","ipeds":"207582"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"14315b39-88dc-4f53-842d-76f0b7835d56","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"TULSA, OK","name":"Oral Roberts University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"68d40a5d-c383-482e-96c7-0aef890f7d4a","gradSchool":"8e7716b7-674f-4c98-9240-dfa0b8c21b2f","metroArea":"532163b9-fe06-47e2-a3c6-0966a366accd","onlineChild":"1a5ca2fd-0d10-4c6d-a4b5-f83cbd3c2285","state":"3c47e197-7bb5-4d24-80d6-d7c74202b941","town":"71b783a6-6be0-449d-a6f5-d481edbeb903","zipCode":"865166d0-c9bb-4ca4-b960-3b254147a1a7"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Oral Roberts","tagline":["4 Year","TULSA, OK"],"type":"College","url":"oral-roberts-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7836835599505563},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":22360},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"990-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"It has been a blessing to attend such an institution.

It has everything I need from great classes and awesome professors. It’s sad that some students, especially freshman, are struggling to keep up. When a student transfers from another institution that hasn’t prepared them well enough, there will be struggle. I’m glad there are so many resources available from professor office hours to tutoring,  to counseling and academic advisors and even a pantry for when you need extra food.

The professors are wanting to teach the students and just want to see the student thrive and learn. They have designated office hours and students can easily schedule an appointment by emailing their professors! The only thing that is a constant problem on campus is the parking situation. There isn't enough parking for the on campus students and the commuter students, making it very difficult to find parking during 'peak hours.'

The campus was conveniently close to home, making commuting easy. The professors were knowledgeable, helpful, and fair in grading, always providing clear expectations and valuable feedback. Their dedication to teaching positively impacted my academic journey and personal growth. The campus was spacious yet small enough to walk across in under 20 minutes, which was convenient since most of my classes were one or two buildings apart. My favorite place on campus was the Titan Student Union Center, a newly built space with a food court downstairs and quiet areas upstairs for studying and relaxation. I also enjoyed the university's amenities, including a large gym and after-school activities. I was involved in a service organization club, which enriched my overall college experience. The campus went through renovations, with new buildings being added, which is much needed, as this is one of the older schools.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-10T18:48:01.480031Z","guid":"5cdf08a7-f06d-4fb1-9c86-ef1c1e3b5f0e","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.885349,33.883627,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.885349,33.883627,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"cd02ff52-03e5-458d-b09d-3ba4b60aac05","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.770007342143906,"count":5448},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university-fullerton/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-state-university-fullerton"}]},{"guid":"21da3a0c-8a34-4306-b85d-c13ac2df3515","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":276,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.74731,"lon":-73.994781},"entity":{"abbreviation":"FIT","alternates":{"ceeb":"2257","ipeds":"191126"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"21da3a0c-8a34-4306-b85d-c13ac2df3515","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"NEW YORK, NY","name":"Fashion Institute of Technology","parentGUIDs":{"college":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"510ffa3e-a740-4fc0-9626-13343de3d1f0","gradSchool":"efa4100f-fed4-42e0-96e5-a8472a45e70e","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"b7b9f690-bb58-4b0f-ae8e-077338fa322d","parent":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"be4375aa-a7b8-433d-9864-a8f40bc9dcc1","zipCode":"b93dc6e5-0fc6-40e0-8b8a-d6e078ab648f"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"FIT","tagline":["4 Year","NEW YORK, NY"],"type":"College","url":"fashion-institute-of-technology","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5279503105590062},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20900},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Studying at FIT has been both challenging and rewarding.

The pressure to secure a job post-graduation is intense, and while I don’t yet see a clear direction, I value the industry-driven approach.

This makes me feel confident in my choice of a college. I am in the accounting program currently, and have nothing but good reviews for my teachers. They are always willing to help and spend extra time on homework or reviewing a concept with you. As for the campus, it is beautiful, especially in the fall with the variety of the hundreds of trees we have. There are a variety of groups to get involved in, and if you do not like any of them it is easy to start a club! However, we do have to pay extra to stay during breaks, which is heartbreaking for the international students and anyone else who are not able to go home during the break. Also, the international students are not able to work during the break without a work visa.

Students were given the necessary information about any changes on campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-07T18:29:19.73742Z","guid":"6138f9b7-daca-4d13-8cae-86c08dbad941","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c15f230bb82a991a4c303591b166c4d77f02af37","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b18a705de2f4f8a13e878310bab38eedb558dc7d","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c09884ee913441b4c032774eb60f607bfaf0925e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b1977e97450cda49185352e9152078a2a96c808f"},"guid":"c7269d58-1f6a-4bda-bbac-d5a9c9690edc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-15T19:36:41.706608Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/56049a4348bc04166b92ac05967b43997bfecfd9"},"guid":"a7e25ff1-0e36-4430-b989-9671dd72c860","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-23T15:29:51.059223Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.507853,30.270917,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.507853,30.270917,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"7f881d5b-d423-4512-b2d6-ef9d77b24bf0","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ee743759850f65cb0e16598fdde5abd75aa8c1de","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ef6c137d81a51016eba4dc891c5af7d261f280c"},"guid":"869f9c48-5feb-499e-b7a0-40279b75d996","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-23T16:09:09.727806Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.75215861848417,"count":3127},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.unf.edu/visit/tour-videos.html#"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-florida/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-north-florida"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.unf.edu/visit/tour-videos.html#"}]},{"guid":"27b66cba-4b92-4353-86d1-b2ae7b62603c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":281,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":26.391218,"lon":-80.108331},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Everglades","alternates":{"ceeb":"3191","ipeds":"385619"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"27b66cba-4b92-4353-86d1-b2ae7b62603c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"BOCA RATON, FL","name":"Everglades University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"5860c3dc-0d35-4433-a652-ad081ac4ada2","gradSchool":"5139fa50-bf2a-4a0b-ac0e-41e6cd333d12","metroArea":"05c150aa-2b84-4e19-a6e6-c57045e43d8b","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","town":"78a56043-9dfb-4756-8672-4efd4acd2f14","zipCode":"ef64e816-967d-4d60-b401-774d344a486e"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Everglades","tagline":["4 Year","BOCA RATON, FL"],"type":"College","url":"everglades-university","variation":8},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7098930481283422},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":28778},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience here at Everglades University has been a wonderful, full filing and educational experience that has brought new and creative ideas to my education.

Studying Art History and Spanish, my professors had very high standards for our writing and research. I felt supported by all of my professors, and encouraged to come to them for help with academics or future plans. I also received a significant amount of financial aid, which made it slightly easier to tolerate the lack of resources in my chosen departments. Finding internship or volunteer opportunities was challenging in a rural town such as Wooster, and I felt that the Career Center was not prepared for students who were pursuing anything other than STEM-focused careers. Housing is adequate, and there are large stores (Meijer, Walmart, etc.) and some restaurants in the area.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-22T19:25:40.609778Z","guid":"70d10c10-a003-4ca3-97db-a160e13c1edf","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"cogdog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2f38e1834e336fe515a93a850f694c32b101381","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe6c0073b905010ef1efc6ad056b6662fd0bda4d","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/13bd177f2856f149a7f767d20c0729f3ad83c3cd","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5d85293a3bcefb05dcb3b606f93663c90f3e8b54"},"guid":"507b3dc5-4b57-4d8d-8e72-6f1195f91d38","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/8763606508/","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-06T18:12:34.514877Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/068435b9e8d8dda7fc59e72a189b7e741db87a3f"},"guid":"fa459e3d-98fb-432b-a3ad-322208713859","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-06T19:29:48.072193Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a55a0755-9952-4dd6-8404-9ab439243d42","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ecbaccabaac0772fd05cdf4bb44d74cd794a4295","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70fe84e2272d5a48a951787e189b8743f0dd758e"},"guid":"1c6dffa2-0e44-4d7e-a830-85ac5918a13e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-06T20:10:57.848303Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.614275414563807,"count":1387},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/63393"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-wooster/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=college-of-wooster"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/63393"}]},{"guid":"02b90d8e-3ae7-4e90-8010-bccedd518371","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":284,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.997258,"lon":-122.067993},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UCSC","alternates":{"ceeb":"4860","ipeds":"110714"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"02b90d8e-3ae7-4e90-8010-bccedd518371","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"SANTA CRUZ, CA","name":"University of California - Santa Cruz","parentGUIDs":{"college":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"49997ec1-1e60-4274-84cb-b2c7ecfe9f49","gradSchool":"e8da8bf3-b398-4281-a5a7-cf33d94a6f71","parent":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"fa40b79b-e2fd-42f8-891a-c5ca2b883962","zipCode":"ce611d12-0c20-4e33-abd7-b436dc471382"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UC Santa Cruz","tagline":["4 Year","SANTA CRUZ, CA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-california-santa-cruz","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.4692013593882753},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17975},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1160-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love that UCSC is a school that is in a forest.

The campus vibe is lively, with tons of clubs and activities to join, which makes meeting people easy. We're super close to outdoor spots like Lake Tahoe for hiking and skiing. Most students hang around campus, and there’s always something happening. The campus is long and skinny, so getting from one end to the other can be a trek, but you get used to it. Safety is solid – I feel really comfortable here, and there are services like Pack Rides for late-night safety. It doesn’t feel like a commuter school; there's a real traditional college atmosphere with spirited Wolf Pack games. Getting involved is key, as there are endless options to find your niche. Overall, great academics, a friendly community, and an ideal location make UNR a unique and exciting place to study.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-25T23:58:52.360905Z","guid":"9b26353b-a070-4870-80e6-2d9141b00061","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/975db557f288b50ec0240014c4338042a8e6db40","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac2c1c472ddfb8f3983e8c9004388085b4c65830","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/40fb8f9932b5e2e291c0be6ed91a7801f7725629","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50895f6d7781a5ae4b84b4d0fcf7ef2a4dd37b61"},"guid":"36d30e34-d2a4-4dff-ab48-178403b0eadc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-10T22:55:21.545133Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fd9c25c0826ff77e66d90dac979de8e049a77bbf"},"guid":"bd8e91be-159a-496a-9dd2-0ea61d74b661","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-30T19:05:59.062244Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.8183072,39.54508,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.8183072,39.54508,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c7127b3f-a306-4911-8e7b-cc03cdf9764a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/165774b0b8e0ea1a0a94dd0e0f2da120d219436b","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/77e3b1afb0b7fe94aba343b2d84ef6273935401f"},"guid":"e45d55b4-e6b0-4fe1-ae53-0395c1c25ced","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-12T18:14:58.087275Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7215250965250966,"count":4144},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.unr.edu/visit/360"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nevada-reno/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-nevada-reno"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.unr.edu/visit/360"}]},{"guid":"344f839e-671e-4d97-972e-611aeff43b34","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":287,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.034355,"lon":-76.139236},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SUNY ESF","alternates":{"ceeb":"2530","ipeds":"196103"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"344f839e-671e-4d97-972e-611aeff43b34","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"SYRACUSE, NY","name":"SUNY College of Environmental Science & Forestry","parentGUIDs":{"college":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"28a5d042-fda4-4889-950c-49ffa0a38969","gradSchool":"c8e750cb-a6a6-418a-802e-8c31ed02ee74","metroArea":"b3afcfda-9914-49b1-bf61-849b0e8454f6","parent":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"5ea50880-17ee-4003-b9fe-f167f7e065f1","zipCode":"8ae6befc-1f74-49ce-a294-3275c7acb620"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"SUNY ESF","tagline":["4 Year","SYRACUSE, NY"],"type":"College","url":"suny-college-of-environmental-science-and-forestry","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6950527169505272},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20928},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1130-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I have loved my experience with ESF! I transferred in halfway through first year and I really found my place. Having many resources from Syracuse university next door is amazing for such a small school, and you really get the best of both worlds. People complain about the food, but for college food it really is above average. The parties are really chill, mostly small backyard parties unless you want to go to SU parties which are bigger and more frat-centered. It is a hard school though, so be prepared. Even the easiest major (environmental studies) is substantially harder than at other schools and is considered a STEM. The faculty is really amazing though.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-10-14T18:05:00.983984Z","guid":"96bd28a4-d42f-440a-9e1b-b7c052a5323e","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.139236,43.034355,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.139236,43.034355,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"8abf325f-f775-400e-b307-460f718ac63b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6750700280112043,"count":357},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-of-environmental-science-and-forestry/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=suny-college-of-environmental-science-and-forestry"}]},{"guid":"9d56b986-2303-4209-8b21-669e0cd89cb3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":288,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.324968,"lon":-93.971928},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Gustavus","alternates":{"ceeb":"6253","ipeds":"173647"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"9d56b986-2303-4209-8b21-669e0cd89cb3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SAINT PETER, MN","name":"Gustavus Adolphus College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"bcac8dfe-5c6c-4074-9156-5802a6dc8d74","state":"534cd634-543d-4983-89c3-22323ac74f77","town":"53aee701-2d1d-484a-9e6c-37485e23b9ee","zipCode":"756e44ff-61e4-413c-85b4-fa2f1fbba7c3"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Gustavus","tagline":["4 Year","SAINT PETER, MN"],"type":"College","url":"gustavus-adolphus-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7389579476329013},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":30297},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Starting my freshman year at Gustavus Adolphus College has been an exciting and rewarding experience. As a football player and biology major, I’ve had to balance academics, athletics, and social life, but I’ve found great support here. With both my parents and my aunt being alumni, Gustavus already felt like home, and my time here so far has exceeded my expectations.\n\nFootball has given me an instant sense of community, with dedicated coaches and supportive teammates pushing me to grow. Academically, my biology classes are challenging but engaging, and the small class sizes allow for meaningful interactions with my professors. The hands-on lab work keeps me excited about my major.\n\nBeyond academics and sports, Gustavus has a welcoming environment, rich traditions, and a beautiful campus. There’s always something happening, making college life both fulfilling and fun. So far, my experience has been everything I hoped for, and I look forward to the journey ahead.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-30T03:51:01.058034Z","guid":"fc4c6b0d-dcf7-4285-8abb-f747028b0060","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/198fb6356672b82326e9cd19f9beb2c2b5efdf13","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d4744fdd0c5fac45e456c7022aca7ca996089bab","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/30d94b83c0cc61a3a95fbe9c57a1288251e6383e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2324074ca927020db87be2794fc6d075d7c67636"},"guid":"17617021-f354-46d6-8542-356495ffb2ae","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-03T14:26:22.930149Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a56995849401f815f324a0236290ed2d6b19202d"},"guid":"cd5500b4-57d7-4398-b3e3-dd25def6f945","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-03T18:19:47.513114Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.971928,44.324968,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.971928,44.324968,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"621e947e-64fe-4183-a820-df9f1af11cd9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/270e48fa79e4b63f51f138956c6d5d4b0eca38d6","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/487c5e0e3f357b0dddc6125cf3ff93d633f15417"},"guid":"66a1b6ad-1fda-4458-87a6-559a19f5cac0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-03T20:31:40.557124Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7782608695652176,"count":920},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://gustavus.edu/#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gustavus-adolphus-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=gustavus-adolphus-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://gustavus.edu/#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"841dcc06-90ca-4638-89fa-7cb926b0ec54","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":289,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.214844,"lon":-81.680234},"entity":{"abbreviation":"App State","alternates":{"ceeb":"5010","ipeds":"197869"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"841dcc06-90ca-4638-89fa-7cb926b0ec54","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"BOONE, NC","name":"Appalachian State University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ba52fd68-37e6-44af-b6b6-54e17fe1eaec","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"10b48ae9-6958-4bbe-9124-8dd204bf748b","gradSchool":"8b45a5a5-aa53-4bc1-ba7b-764d061e1cad","parent":"ba52fd68-37e6-44af-b6b6-54e17fe1eaec","state":"6c719699-2dd3-4c44-9fc0-2d38b35cc1c8","town":"f293ca16-f762-41eb-a24b-5aff9e91b874","zipCode":"a3a23ffc-cb1f-4ad1-a740-744bfcdd4a3c"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"App State","tagline":["4 Year","BOONE, NC"],"type":"College","url":"appalachian-state-university","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8307796000898674},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13084},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1100-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a student at Appalachian State University, I can really appreciate how committed the school is to academic excellence and getting us involved.

Professors are generally approachable and willing to help, and there are numerous student organizations and events that foster connections. The university also offers a variety of resources, such as career services and tutoring, to help students succeed academically and professionally. However, there are areas that could be improved. Parking can be a significant issue, with limited spaces and high permit costs.  Some students also feel that communication from the administration could be more transparent, especially regarding tuition changes and campus policies.

The university offers a wide range of programs, and most courses were well-structured and informative. The curriculum provided a solid foundation in my field of study, and there were opportunities to engage in hands-on learning through labs and research. Many professors are passionate, knowledgeable, and genuinely invested in student success. They're approachable, willing to help outside of class, and provide valuable insights into their respective fields. However, there were professors who were less engaged, making some classes feel more like self-study. This can vary between departments, so students may have different experiences depending on their major. Overall, USA provides a decent academic experience with strong programs and dedicated faculty members. Students who seek out the best professors and utilize academic resources will likely have a rewarding experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-11T20:50:51.439233Z","guid":"86492f42-bbe7-4bfc-8a26-e687b7a8dd79","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.18189,30.695081,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.18189,30.695081,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"414d04f8-fec0-4e60-8009-b3c7dceb853d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8099078341013826,"count":1736},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/admissions/visitourcampus.html"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-alabama/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-south-alabama"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/admissions/visitourcampus.html"}]},{"guid":"c65e2a91-f153-4d31-9aac-b838a7c2cd07","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":292,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":46.919144,"lon":-98.001762},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Valley City State","alternates":{"ceeb":"6480","ipeds":"200572"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"c65e2a91-f153-4d31-9aac-b838a7c2cd07","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"VALLEY CITY, ND","name":"Valley City State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ded02d89-d264-41de-b01a-b975b1ba1e9d","gradSchool":"83531317-4997-43c5-9954-b93cf9d63273","state":"d1244c19-7280-4215-9d73-1e03e23b8c70","town":"4ca74f32-8c67-4674-94aa-a5ac20c8a7b2","zipCode":"c561e251-c0ba-45d2-9577-dd22382d91ca"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Valley City State","tagline":["4 Year","VALLEY CITY, ND"],"type":"College","url":"valley-city-state-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8341121495327103},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12164},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1030-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really liked how no matter what all the staff cares and would sit a talk to you, it didn’t matter how busy they where they would make time.

It would also be great to have more support and opportunities for students from different backgrounds to feel seen and heard.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-24T04:57:19.652486Z","guid":"e6c9d4a3-60e7-40cd-ba32-54d58480a7b5","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdca7b8751acf2f6f4192f9235e323c8dbd48584","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fc61a0daee48fb63f22f7b4ffe06da45b13c28f7","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/634bcd62d402b08514337fcb03b277b452fc17de","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/87ae5dc6e4e21a66a8863f23447c1c9d7cf9d277"},"guid":"02cd22f8-cc34-4487-be57-417db34ac9a1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-23T15:10:55.396202Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c4911ed096d5479a2c7f13d21a5c82d39cd9f5f8"},"guid":"cbc63ea5-4db0-44f2-a687-886c71ecbe2a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-22T17:36:56.420035Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.875527,34.225223,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.875527,34.225223,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"9ecd2038-ea24-45ca-90ad-3f2808866a60","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/df6820782f66bcb1171bf61a21a58984886385b7","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5b9bdd77dd8ef71d4dbe20759bdffa1bdcc857a9"},"guid":"39195454-09a2-4460-8e26-ecbb12b4274e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-14T14:09:23.696983Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8068072866730587,"count":2086},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/uncw"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-wilmington/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-north-carolina-wilmington"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/uncw"}]},{"guid":"0f3f6467-1dca-4dda-9c65-37c2117fadb3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":294,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.20443,"lon":-85.917772},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Sewanee","alternates":{"ceeb":"1842","ipeds":"221519"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"0f3f6467-1dca-4dda-9c65-37c2117fadb3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SEWANEE, TN","name":"Sewanee - The University of the South","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"f688c218-82b0-4243-8144-e427bcdc31e0","gradSchool":"8e1fa157-7fdb-49ad-811b-ff8321044584","state":"eb2a19be-aace-48f2-9508-e8ed89070367","town":"b4971db7-b55a-482c-98c7-30a51d07467d","zipCode":"e45a75ff-3876-4aba-8656-fc971750a5aa"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Sewanee","tagline":["4 Year","SEWANEE, TN"],"type":"College","url":"sewanee-the-university-of-the-south","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5231542158147663},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33061},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1200-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved my time as a Sewanee student! I knew I wanted a college campus where I could step out of my classes and see trees rather than a highway. This place definitely gave me that. I hiked and camped on the Mountain regularly, and I enjoyed every minute of walking between classes on a campus that feels like Hogwarts. Being the first generation in my family to attend a four year college, I was intimidated at first and had some major concerns about fitting in. These concerns were replaced with a community that I felt, and still feel, deeply connected to. Playing a sport gave me a good outlet to make friends, but it didn't feel like the only way to socialize. This place is a unique blend of stunning scenery, good-natured people, and quirky traditions. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a strong academic college with fun people in a great setting.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-10-11T18:25:03.739232Z","guid":"c23a3109-e87d-401d-89fd-d35dff3b9a02","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6f5f8844ae4c1220f02b1a9e69385dde108aed5d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ee38b0b153dee745a088937b4944f49675068e0.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6f5f8844ae4c1220f02b1a9e69385dde108aed5d.jpg"},"guid":"f4e204d9-1e0c-40f5-91b5-7c901cff9c44","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c3ac4ace47767b06bbb7cfca24f111e77f31d085"},"guid":"83627176-5f06-4b9d-9fa5-fe3ce9c148f7","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-03-30T22:13:49.1631Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"94916b67-3b21-4727-91f5-5d1a2ce5c1f6","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9508d75a282a3fea22de775a7ef815c9254b0e1f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58105db7fce572ab1fc2d144956e4b367c72bd8c"},"guid":"66272278-1a9b-4b79-b3ff-a15ce19f8358","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-03-15T20:16:54.714897Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.74375,"count":480},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://new.sewanee.edu/admission-aid/virtual-visit-options/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sewanee-the-university-of-the-south/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=sewanee-the-university-of-the-south"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://new.sewanee.edu/admission-aid/virtual-visit-options/"}]},{"guid":"660f3659-7387-4d8b-91d7-a3c56fd9f684","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":295,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":45.571807,"lon":-122.726859},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UP","alternates":{"ceeb":"4847","ipeds":"209825"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"660f3659-7387-4d8b-91d7-a3c56fd9f684","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PORTLAND, OR","name":"University of Portland","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"373aa912-2a11-481b-a647-5c09c5bb1e96","gradSchool":"d38a9be6-1221-46f8-92cf-b314d59df1cd","metroArea":"bbed0281-ada4-4dc2-9062-eb63a8a7ba53","neighborhood":"04f2b908-a146-4f10-8515-49b21e1444e6","state":"bb5bef7b-e5b0-48bd-bb7f-ea89dc2109e9","town":"12ef2269-431e-407b-a25d-17c1c6aa451d","zipCode":"975a3910-9d67-4934-8069-e331e08fe156"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"University of Portland","tagline":["4 Year","PORTLAND, OR"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-portland","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9251136139102945},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33717},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1180-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"When I first came to the University of Portland, I only knew a few people. The weather was a bit hard to deal with, especially because it made the campus feel dreary, also it only added onto the feeling of not quite belonging. However, people here are more than welcoming and it was not hard to find people to become friends with. The professors that I have had have been pretty good, I have mostly had professors that I enjoyed, with only a couple that I could have done without. While it is a small school, there are a lot of clubs and student-led organizations that put in a lot of work to create fun student activities. I would say that sports aren't a huge part of the community, but I think that because our main sport is soccer instead of football.

I loved class, because I got to engage experts who imparted understanding and wisdom far beyond what I could learn from a standard textbook or online resource. This rivaled the experience of my friends who attended large, public universities where the bachelor programs are often taught by adjunct professors or graduate students.\nSPIRITUALLY - Taylor is a Christ-centered community that so beautifully holds fast to the truth of scripture without losing sight of the humility and love of Jesus. While no community is perfect, Taylor is marked with deeply committed relationships and campus life that exudes the fruit of the Spirit. One of my favorite memories from Taylor was gathering with my friends in the Prayer Chapel 2-3 times a week for informal worship, prayer, and Bible reading.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-16T10:23:42.796502Z","guid":"74b255f8-f8fb-4974-a9ab-d877438e83d5","helpfulness":2,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43e93ee6f5b628b26705b7e12fee3002a038fe0a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b015f6533ba30b9359b96a5b0885e45b5c2f22fc.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43e93ee6f5b628b26705b7e12fee3002a038fe0a.jpg"},"guid":"2e621640-3c49-4abc-89e6-3493ad01f241","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.49399509999999,40.4567133,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.49399509999999,40.4567133,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"240b7583-5115-41e4-bea7-49feca194437","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7106690777576854,"count":1106},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/taylor-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=taylor-university"}]},{"guid":"6784c328-54ab-4dd3-bff7-e2b2c20bfd5e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":303,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.313584,"lon":-91.803971},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Luther","alternates":{"ceeb":"6375","ipeds":"153834"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6784c328-54ab-4dd3-bff7-e2b2c20bfd5e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"DECORAH, IA","name":"Luther College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"bbe4ff3d-6a36-4c82-8967-abf19b7d8435","state":"63450988-8f98-4a6e-ac40-4ce42032e5a5","town":"dcd35f2c-785d-463b-bc3f-b2908622bda8","zipCode":"4e95455b-0552-4964-9d67-f509557f1719"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Luther","tagline":["4 Year","DECORAH, IA"],"type":"College","url":"luther-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.753199268738574},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":25734},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1080-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It's very pretty in Decorah, and Luther capitalizes on that with frequent hikes and other outdoor activities through the rec services.

Overall, this experience has been challenging but yet exciting and adventurist. Every day I learn something new on the campus, but it isn't just the campus it's also about myself.  I learned how to not depend on others. Learning how to interact with other people on campus. I wasn't an outgoing person but being here and joining new clubs has helped me gain that social experience and other life-skills. The different writing centers, resume/cover letter sessions helped me gain experience on what to expect for my career path. The writing centers helped me be more confident in my writing and speech skills. Although I am currently freshman I can't wait to endorse and open more life obstacles in my journey of education. Honestly the way USD encourage students interact, career fairs, social banquets.

The students do a great job of welcoming new incoming students and inviting them out into the city. Being in a prime location in the Richmond district next to famous sites like Golden Gate Park, Haight-Ashbury Street, as well as Alamo Square gives the USF its own unique being in the heart of the city of San Francisco. The academics at USF being in the School of Management have been a bit of a challenge, but only if you do not utilize the resources available to you. The attentive professors and small class sizes make it easy to receive the help you need through 1:1 office hours with your professor or even online coffee chat meetings with the TAs to ask about any upcoming assignments or exams.

These connections would be valuable for fostering professional relationships and building a sense of community among students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-23T17:51:30.369144Z","guid":"52c37d86-c98a-470e-8813-c5a0935e6c49","helpfulness":2,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f773a428106ecc09de2bbdd0ed46c74e5999c4a4","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a6245ebb30e9a69c43643e6af3d95b649207bb0d","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b35e6c48e396227f0d8881f08ae542a283d5ce63","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/90df55a03387c8114a5b25e158ec555a658b6f0c"},"guid":"fcb27a04-6999-467a-ba0b-580e51a1f16d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-22T20:30:36.767793Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4995d73cd6af5af6519df5d6a38fd22ffcf1dddd"},"guid":"3d441f18-4f32-486a-a080-0bfdcdb2ca57","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.42587,33.928569,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.42587,33.928569,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"679d74ea-40f3-4ef9-84ca-96609da118e7","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2018afea4af7328c2f29d283ac77f2d5280bf885","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b3ee3061b20ea37ed1226ad2e6dc7ea793a65e5d"},"guid":"b7a6a807-7628-4a62-9cba-ca1bf956d469","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-22T16:50:38.023801Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.152610441767068,"count":2988},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://calbaptist.edu/admissions-aid/undergraduate/visit/virtual-experiences"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-baptist-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-baptist-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://calbaptist.edu/admissions-aid/undergraduate/visit/virtual-experiences"}]},{"guid":"e6b27750-9b1a-4557-8ae5-5f40eac8aa6c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":311,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.957914,"lon":-81.934572},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Wofford","alternates":{"ceeb":"5912","ipeds":"218973"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e6b27750-9b1a-4557-8ae5-5f40eac8aa6c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SPARTANBURG, SC","name":"Wofford College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"17bd6c0f-d3ce-476a-881c-ab5385f51860","metroArea":"e3ad1b0a-bb02-4b78-8bb8-9e4ea6ea7770","state":"4e14b3cc-29b7-46c8-b531-601bf3625739","town":"e7fe817f-a913-48db-bbdd-3f59e700993a","zipCode":"c0c0dfb9-fe36-48c8-9fe3-17fdb8a85226"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Wofford","tagline":["4 Year","SPARTANBURG, SC"],"type":"College","url":"wofford-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6018079096045198},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":31192},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1200-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really enjoy the Wofford community.

However, there is the struggle of diversity throughout campus. There are efforts being made to change this which I believe is beneficial to the University as a whole.

Logan is a smaller town but it has such a fun vibe and the people are so welcoming. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it feels like home here as most of the students share the same values as me. It has been amazing to make friends who understand me and share similar beliefs. Academically Utah State has been awesome and has helped me grow personally and professionally. There is so much to get involved in from clubs to events and the basketball games are so fun. The energy and school spirit is one of the reasons I love Utah State. However, outside from campus Logan is a smaller town so there isn't a ton to do.. There isn't really a party scene, but it has been great for me because that doesn't align with my values.

The academics are strong, with most professors being helpful and supportive. Coursework is challenging but manageable, and the extracurricular opportunities are plentiful, providing students with many ways to get involved and enjoy campus life. However, housing is subpar, poorly managed, and often frustrating for students. Food options are limited in variety and availability, with inconvenient hours. The biggest issue lies in the university's disorganized leadership, which often fails to follow through on promises and disregards student concerns. This creates a sense that the administration is disconnected and indifferent to student welfare. \n\nFor those who can focus on academics and social life without dealing much with the university's management, JU can be a rewarding place to learn. However, for others, the administrative shortcomings can make it difficult to fully enjoy the student experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-17T13:40:12.721789Z","guid":"3a600bfc-773a-4554-9e12-d56624c8a3ef","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/401ab9023da1bd5eb69d02c3c56a293ed5c01053","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2edaa016cafe494850c2f71b3fc8e93184eb1473","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bd697d2e7f949605f8adcc6c1e9c115ee29d56b7","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a3c9f45ed75cd2a9d09894eb69a27046aaf11721"},"guid":"ef799761-a48e-4b2c-85eb-744f56a80a39","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-12T21:05:17.485123Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/67ea1e4584bc0006b63515933011b0fa3212f775"},"guid":"53100587-adda-45d0-820e-11c643bf8942","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-13T15:02:27.599001Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.60706,30.350349,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.60706,30.350349,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"58c14ae2-1e3f-482a-8b29-0808d044b745","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/22328a0f123666c9792ccedb5a6b196dfc523d5c","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70df253b76a1c57b7c0608e714656d277f938e68"},"guid":"f1659883-e1b3-4b24-98fd-b5af7a8b4d9b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-12T21:02:09.046507Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7735849056603774,"count":848},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.ju.edu/admissions/visit/index.php?utm_source=niche.com%2Freferral&utm_medium=niche&utm_campaign=visit25"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/jacksonville-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=jacksonville-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.ju.edu/admissions/visit/index.php?utm_source=niche.com%2Freferral&utm_medium=niche&utm_campaign=visit25"}]},{"guid":"e3d4751e-98d6-483b-ac91-89481256bfc7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":317,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.84435,"lon":-96.917879},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UDallas","alternates":{"ceeb":"6868","ipeds":"224323"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e3d4751e-98d6-483b-ac91-89481256bfc7","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"IRVING, TX","name":"University of Dallas","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a2ab1556-ac00-46a0-ac94-e9dfedc9331a","gradSchool":"0328dcbe-d39f-47bb-9aed-e3d74704a738","metroArea":"57178ed6-801f-4b4f-913e-135f42c4afe3","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"8885e6ed-d72c-43e3-a60d-e398cb4e234c","zipCode":"384495e0-cbcc-4e52-806b-ca7dbaf76c65"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"University of Dallas","tagline":["4 Year","IRVING, TX"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-dallas","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.586951474344091},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":27250},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1170-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"UD is known for its rigorous liberal arts curriculum, particularly in philosophy, theology, and business.

As an incoming freshman I took a one credit course the week before school started called Adventure WVU where I went camping for 3 nights. Went white water rafting, rock climbing and met my now best friends! For 75 dollars I had the experience of a lifetime and got to experience WV at an amazing level! There are intramural sports and activities for every walk of life and many fun things to experience and do.  I would recommend WVU to anyone. It’s an amazing place.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-23T02:22:28.740002Z","guid":"6e9f099c-c3de-49e8-8408-c5f9fa43eae1","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d87035a0257f78f7c33dbb14ea483bc78d324728.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f8d67407b759044028948a3974c9da84d2503d11.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d87035a0257f78f7c33dbb14ea483bc78d324728.jpg"},"guid":"1ff738d8-c874-4d99-af57-677d4e611bb0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.953926,39.63468,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.953926,39.63468,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"900a9dc5-0f97-4a9e-818b-05fca7f4bdfa","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.82719459791283,"count":3258},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/west-virginia-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=west-virginia-university"}]},{"guid":"bdac122e-a35a-4b98-81df-b60b0070f01d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":319,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.40715,"lon":-75.658031},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Scranton","alternates":{"ceeb":"2929","ipeds":"215929"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"bdac122e-a35a-4b98-81df-b60b0070f01d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SCRANTON, PA","name":"University of Scranton","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"4b2cc785-065c-4840-9038-036a9bcb04e1","gradSchool":"520994b4-7183-46f7-ab7f-75ba42bea18f","metroArea":"e6068a69-3a78-47d6-8a05-ee65f9915dfc","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"e8df0ff3-d246-4f3f-8edb-e5fb8db9837b","zipCode":"8d20643b-f521-49a3-895c-a76086b6c7b0"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Scranton","tagline":["4 Year","SCRANTON, PA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-scranton","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8435466946484785},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":35526},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1150-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love attending The University of Scranton.

One thing I would like to see change is the prices at the bookstore. Although buying campus merch is not necessary, it is nice to have some but the prices can make it hard to get new clothes.

However, the campus life is a little boring, due to few active clubs on campus, and the banning of school affliated fraternities making the party life on campus none existent, so there isn't much to do outside of off campus parties.  Room and board is a scam. For a minium of 5000 dollars a semester, you get extremely basic housing accommodation with very few services. The food is terrible, always has long lines, and is equally overpriced. The area directly around CUA failed to gentrify, and now has a high crime. The school is very conservative, banning anything that isn't aligned with Catholic teaching. Overall, if you're catholic and want a classical education in a great city, come here!

The campus is inviting, with incredibly talented professors who have inspired me to pursue an academic career. The Kinesiology program consists of 140 credit hours and offers connections to graduate schools throughout the state. Most of my classes this past semester have been in the Recreation and Bayou buildings, and I highly recommend UHCL. The campus is academically oriented and boasts a diverse community in terms of culture, race, gender, and religion. I wholeheartedly recommend UHCL to anyone seeking an affordable, diverse, and engaging university experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-02T19:27:54.997616Z","guid":"d0bef24f-f7a1-44e5-8f19-a1eede7c28a0","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b00a931e4a85611bf03b32cb17c476068ce332d0","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b90673cc5fc31bf4b24ac1d43ce7b186c0526277","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e9bc388848167119f242fe213b9d0cb5e752f522","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2706c69d0da489d6f88aa94cf2e712a8da468961"},"guid":"415901d2-92f9-4c5d-acf6-f88c33f53bd0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-21T19:48:46.891962Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/66bd331cc7534f1cf3e87659b229c344b911a2e9"},"guid":"f98a01d0-902f-4105-ad71-52da3956e29d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-09-27T16:51:04.844613Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.098129,29.582523,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.098129,29.582523,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c7347b76-7357-4854-afc4-b66afbebaf4d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9447300771208225,"count":778},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://videos.advantagedesigngroup.com/media/UHCL+-+Section+1c+-+Welcome+-+Campus+Spotlights/1_py09mruf"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-houston-clear-lake/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-houston-clear-lake"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://videos.advantagedesigngroup.com/media/UHCL+-+Section+1c+-+Welcome+-+Campus+Spotlights/1_py09mruf"}]},{"guid":"e2c0377b-5008-4cca-b4db-e5a166bbd0af","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":324,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.742859,"lon":-74.248753},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SHU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2811","ipeds":"186584"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e2c0377b-5008-4cca-b4db-e5a166bbd0af","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SOUTH ORANGE, NJ","name":"Seton Hall University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"024bd7fb-e9aa-4c55-bce3-41fe90a7896f","gradSchool":"558534ec-b91c-4c91-a9ae-4697f6acda67","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","state":"ed4102c4-b16f-4ccd-8d8b-ccfeb8fa21ea","town":"9a6c30d7-4f7d-4319-84d2-5b73559e0163","zipCode":"e4c71419-be02-4105-acd5-09a1e3fd319b"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Seton Hall","tagline":["4 Year","SOUTH ORANGE, NJ"],"type":"College","url":"seton-hall-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7506509657611441},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33472},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1230-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"y experience at Seton Hall University has been both enriching and challenging in many ways. The best part has been the strong sense of community, with professors who are passionate about their subjects and genuinely invested in student success. The university offers great opportunities for networking, internships, and career preparation, which help students gain real-world experience. Additionally, the campus is beautiful, and there are plenty of student organizations and events that make college life engaging. However, some challenges include the high cost of tuition, occasional administrative issues, and the need for more dining and housing options. There are also some professors who are less engaging or ineffective in their teaching, which can make certain courses frustrating. Additionally, the campus food could use significant improvement in both variety and quality. I would love to see better faculty accountability, more student support services, and an upgrade in dining options.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-13T20:50:41.939141Z","guid":"2afcf8dc-b610-4d4b-b8ae-3e1fbf5cf898","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe0ce2ec063351b149af26d2a6dc214c789d1d86.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0ce3887cdc7a604a8f4c48a8b5f629ed90931bd.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe0ce2ec063351b149af26d2a6dc214c789d1d86.jpg"},"guid":"c810f3d8-b9e1-4986-9af2-65dac9ed745a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2304d0a020e897e94e7411f5978201a18a974bdb"},"guid":"486c325e-7a08-485f-9ddb-e597ed2a255b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:18:27.249957Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"950cd189-97a5-46f7-9a82-a77f390b2f1c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4543b83e82dfae686106c3da8d3c85205835f5a0","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4543b83e82dfae686106c3da8d3c85205835f5a0"},"guid":"3022c338-dca5-45cd-a9a2-203e89e50a43","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7389162561576357,"count":2233},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.shu.edu/the_college_tour.html"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hall-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=seton-hall-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.shu.edu/the_college_tour.html"}]},{"guid":"11033fd3-a5b8-436e-9eda-3421da26563a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":325,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":30.264672,"lon":-97.721698},"entity":{"abbreviation":"HTU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6280","ipeds":"225575"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"11033fd3-a5b8-436e-9eda-3421da26563a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"AUSTIN, TX","name":"Huston-Tillotson University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e21cc14f-2b89-40ad-b7b9-14dbbe3eb8ff","gradSchool":"082566d5-bcaa-4fc8-8f46-8210b9b87eb4","metroArea":"d2312770-a485-4f2c-9696-b2da8062965a","neighborhood":"fb62f8a2-e16a-446e-bc9a-05eb86f5c3a9","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"5ad4b2d9-b65d-4bd2-8382-8243203069aa","zipCode":"386709ee-ff4d-4074-bed1-8ff494538332"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Huston-Tillotson","tagline":["4 Year","AUSTIN, TX"],"type":"College","url":"huston-tillotson-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5193633952254642},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":21069},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"840-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The school obviously could use more funding, being an older HBCU.

I enjoy the small class sizes, which give students more opportunities to work closely with professors and better understand the class material. Participation in athletics is one of my favorite activities for students on campus. Gonzaga has a popular tradition among students to camp out the night before basketball games to get the best seats in the Kennel. In addition to academics and athletics, there are many extracurricular activities such as clubs (academic and social) as well as intramural sports for students to get involved in on campus. One thing Gonzaga could improve is providing better resources for students of color to navigate attending a PWI (primarily white institution). Many of the resources are student-run, and it would be helpful to see Gonzaga offer more support to students of color.","categories":["Overall

It was the only school that provided me with a way to work full-time, earn my dual degree for teaching, and still take care of my family. I was an older student, 36 when I enrolled, and the workload was challenging but doable. Some professors were better than others at engaging online students, but I only had one professor that I really did not enjoy.\n\nI loved that I could rate and review each class and professor after each class, and I appreciated the online platform. It was easy to navigate. One thing I would have appreciated more was some kind of notification for when my counselors changed. There were several times I would log in and see a new name for my counselor, and that was quite frustrating.\n\nI feel like the teaching program gave me a lot of great information that prepared me for a teaching career and set me up for success. I also loved the graduation itself. It was such a beautiful ceremony and well-organized.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-07T19:47:27.113545Z","guid":"01443e4e-0bae-4458-85e9-b77a1b157e68","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23d62723255403bf579fc4d39cdc3eb78597b403","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9f8fe53ccc13ba55dfb7480cb48cf7d7d176f995","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/842ba01cf3eef4d745c150135ddd35c666ea9c63","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8351e587a6659f7f894a17beb30d6c5af295d1eb"},"guid":"c1440a70-5702-4bf4-bfaa-ba785aa19867","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-03-21T00:51:47.360562Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d53f6c9a808c42bb9f1939beeda17fa9c613a3f1"},"guid":"fc4e6a50-35bb-418a-b596-8fa488982729","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.129917,33.512172,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.129917,33.512172,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"57025be6-8714-49a7-a75e-10b4c638c77f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dd7d9d7a11ed3f2637eae30f9e81f8835378ede5","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dd7d9d7a11ed3f2637eae30f9e81f8835378ede5"},"guid":"5818dfd0-488c-46aa-9890-c2d424d0b0b2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.1839543156712224,"count":10682},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.gcu.edu/admissions/visit-gcu-campus"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/grand-canyon-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=grand-canyon-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.gcu.edu/admissions/visit-gcu-campus"}]},{"guid":"5227aaf0-02d7-497d-ad78-aeacf304eb38","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":331,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":47.610138,"lon":-122.3197},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4695","ipeds":"236595"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"5227aaf0-02d7-497d-ad78-aeacf304eb38","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SEATTLE, WA","name":"Seattle University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"fa431d9e-f005-401a-87a9-ca0d1327175a","gradSchool":"9235aeb0-a0b7-4ba1-aeb6-01bc08f9c61c","metroArea":"6023ccf7-09a4-4571-8543-3d06a201095e","neighborhood":"949cae0a-0db4-4eaf-b4e7-bd2c6254a4ea","state":"95b0bd28-1551-4c12-9876-7abb43198184","town":"e219f29a-c042-4f1e-a380-f3bbc2768ed8","zipCode":"b2c761cd-3953-4ef8-9b28-4b25df355755"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Seattle U","tagline":["4 Year","SEATTLE, WA"],"type":"College","url":"seattle-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8515250819258886},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":35412},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1150-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Seattle University, a private Jesuit institution in Seattle, Washington, offers a values-driven education with small class sizes, strong professional programs, and a focus on social justice. Its urban location provides excellent networking opportunities and access to major companies like Amazon and Microsoft. The campus is beautiful and fosters a close-knit community.\nHowever, high tuition costs, limited housing, and the city’s expensive living environment pose challenges. Additionally, the lack of a strong athletics culture and parking difficulties may be drawbacks for some students.\nTo improve, the university could expand housing and financial aid, enhance career services, strengthen campus life, and advance sustainability initiatives. Despite its challenges, Seattle University is a strong choice for students seeking academic excellence and ethical leadership in a dynamic urban setting.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-22T23:53:25.961877Z","guid":"b242c18b-2409-45c6-a27b-058c6b2f5594","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e00ed63453de585f62f45185d916cbba0daf999f","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1d1631f348d3056458b247f0a92afd2a1034ac35","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b89b71e7ea3444a1cfdceb0f1e90aaf1725b2b9","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1bdf7e7d3d280a7ab9d5b68c7b424254bc4d7a47"},"guid":"85bb3d8f-6432-413f-a377-6c2693ddc6f6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-08T21:38:25.22368Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24b62574c4e9dba457cdef0343ceb314f51dd90a"},"guid":"31e88703-9154-43ad-996e-ef50deb581dd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-08T22:25:46.535055Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.3197,47.610138,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.3197,47.610138,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"9043bbcd-34e4-44dd-a9cb-6f0eefad538f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/88cc797d1d56309a918619e7f8d1f1f91f8a6249","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b368f78534cd6403079211136126db0a548b72f3"},"guid":"ab449588-c953-4286-a7a0-b6245363294c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-02T17:37:46.205346Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7156580211335255,"count":1041},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.seattleu.edu/virtual-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seattle-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=seattle-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.seattleu.edu/virtual-tour/"}]},{"guid":"f668bff9-0793-44cd-81ea-0b66aa099485","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":332,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.899215,"lon":-87.946096},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Elmhurst","alternates":{"ceeb":"1204","ipeds":"144962"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f668bff9-0793-44cd-81ea-0b66aa099485","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"ELMHURST, IL","name":"Elmhurst University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"eee987d8-6a90-4a02-b4ab-40c458ea8b5f","gradSchool":"d9454c2f-b93d-43d3-bc01-379f243df9e7","metroArea":"b1fe05c5-1876-422b-81a7-8dfa8da9acfd","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"af3f9df4-02a4-4aa2-89c9-bcc934049e0e","zipCode":"4713a6f6-9c28-43c7-a2ac-50add41a8d7f"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Elmhurst","tagline":["4 Year","ELMHURST, IL"],"type":"College","url":"elmhurst-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7612255678816693},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24108},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"980-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Elmhurst University because it has a lot of qualified professors to teach us our intended majors.

The school is fairly small, but is pretty well maintained and in a safe location. They have very relaxing scenery due to the cattle fields and many trees and fields around campus, and many of the buildings are visually pleasing. The housing on campus is sometimes a hassle to deal with and the lack of parking is immense. The upkeep in the buildings is often lacking although it could be fixed with some effort. The Campus dining is OK at the most, and \"Gives food poisoning\" at the worst. They have very little choices for healthy eating, and tend to lean more towards southern country food as their go to for dining. I would like to see more effort for food variety and safety, as well as some increase in effort by the campus services, as many people are unhappy with how slow and inefficient the school runs. Overall, it is a good experience, though it could better in some ways.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-19T03:11:02.681314Z","guid":"1ce5c955-f70f-46ef-9d41-304d86036096","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.235087,33.291195,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.235087,33.291195,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a7a3bb61-a430-4ee9-b607-07fa606af91a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.718266253869969,"count":646},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-arkansas-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=southern-arkansas-university"}]},{"guid":"ae4f33c6-3e0d-4015-96f6-9f94f2bbd789","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":336,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":37.52577,"lon":-120.852511},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Cal State Stanislaus","alternates":{"ceeb":"4713","ipeds":"110495"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"ae4f33c6-3e0d-4015-96f6-9f94f2bbd789","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"TURLOCK, CA","name":"California State University - Stanislaus","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"8d5ddd10-57d8-4b3a-aa7d-01aa44352123","gradSchool":"90b64a1d-e6e6-4ddc-a403-1426e8bb8cc3","metroArea":"6552872c-988a-4365-b3cb-5a76f18b8797","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"12c47324-c813-4be4-80b8-dc32d5fa3073","zipCode":"730611c5-d636-4928-8f82-abae642771d6"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Cal State Stanislaus","tagline":["4 Year","TURLOCK, CA"],"type":"College","url":"california-state-university-stanislaus","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9661016949152542},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":7555},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I completed my undergrad online however the school is very diverse has great athletics fun school activities great for students and families!

The things you learn are actually applicable to life and work and things you take with you and use for years. Teachers are for the most part kind and caring. Big shoutouts to Dr. Mauri and Professor Erkis. They actually care about their students and I’ll never forget them even many years later. Being so close to the city is amazing, but you still get some of the peace that comes with living outside of it. The campus is absolutely gorgeous. I didn’t choose any center city schools because they didn’t have the same real campus feel. It feels like you’re at Hogwarts. I have an amazing job since graduating as a financial advisor, this school has truly taught me so much.

With full-time work came lots of speed bumps in the road that would prevent me from accomplishing work and meeting deadlines. However, for the most part, every professor I had was very empathetic and allowed me the time to turn in work that was truly done to the best of my ability.  The only change I would suggest to make is to increase the amount of hands-on teaching and lecturing to online students. Often times book pages are assigned and a mix of Ted talks or other various media is given as supplements for a lesson/module. This puts a lot more pressure on online students to have to implement their own learning methods since there is minimal professor-to-student direction.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-09T04:20:58.148225Z","guid":"098d7d31-321c-4444-98d1-b6db8e3d2089","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c1d02509d151e052f27ab7dc576f9c6a414f2fa9","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a64425cbb4eada2d7e6ec2de0e6c03eb06b7fa91","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6103f35963047161d1e66ea9f7bd7a665cd1219d","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7be8b57b836216540e3cfd9a9c921d6f92941baa"},"guid":"238c510d-a50e-4322-9e58-80eb9e15706e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-12T20:35:12.370639Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/339e3ed652a220013449069b03d0a19b90d44f19"},"guid":"77a383f9-468d-47f5-9d0c-a59bc168d5d7","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-11-14T22:30:16.789684Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-147.8235176,64.85734099999999,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-147.8235176,64.85734099999999,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"0985499f-3216-4385-98ae-5d469cafd551","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac097cce09afda300f4795a3d316e3cd72012d95","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2614fa3480459f0a2a77461633673be6cbeaeee6"},"guid":"b235ec69-2766-4b4e-982f-4ed973271bd1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-12T17:36:01.900431Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.519176800748363,"count":1069},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/uaf/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-alaska-fairbanks/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-alaska-fairbanks"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/uaf/"}]},{"guid":"ab1a251c-f240-4436-86fb-89c4136c70ed","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":341,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.393008,"lon":-76.612268},"entity":{"abbreviation":"TU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5404","ipeds":"164076"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"ab1a251c-f240-4436-86fb-89c4136c70ed","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"TOWSON, MD","name":"Towson University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"7e5be34d-4791-43dd-9ee6-7826849edd76","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"7d82d5a7-19aa-4318-86ef-686246556878","gradSchool":"43044117-8dc7-4cda-b868-8dc152de64e2","metroArea":"0189964a-f9df-4fcf-9220-bfe5e9e75a1b","parent":"7e5be34d-4791-43dd-9ee6-7826849edd76","state":"695ce602-38b9-45be-95e7-6646da7cffd8","town":"01da69c6-d3d4-4f26-a6a3-82b524ba0767","zipCode":"3494d419-535f-4dda-8620-f67a787c3b82"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Towson","tagline":["4 Year","TOWSON, MD"],"type":"College","url":"towson-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7859876195835678},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14443},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1010-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"For my first year attending Towson University, my experience here had been very great.

Other than that Towson is a very good school!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-07T00:38:26.199727Z","guid":"da79963d-d2f6-450d-aa9a-5ceb5f271187","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/91ecb9f9cd8aa82499171ead67f78cbb147d1a02","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a0f7ddebb3c47bbc921742742921de541a0d6496","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1a27b7b6651f681434b2b2bdd15ee025cf708fa5","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f50388ef900dc6b009b3d45a4fa2effb97a2b5f"},"guid":"b90da835-10b2-4720-aadf-5dfc5889164c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-07T19:34:22.709774Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/49c0af184550290d42af6dc9021002fecf69ee67"},"guid":"5c0168bc-e437-4354-9a07-ebd330e56606","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-09T17:39:26.15655Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.612268,39.393008,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.612268,39.393008,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3bce0e23-ac03-4b55-9345-a3936aeacf9b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3946e74abf55663f8f39d0027e9bb5e43b00d791","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/918b9b30d712e905c05c63b18885a3d9ae88baff"},"guid":"54124084-3e9f-424b-99fe-31932dac5707","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-07T19:30:12.454549Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.716288197364732,"count":3567},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.towson.edu/visit/virtual-tour.html#"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/towson-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=towson-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.towson.edu/visit/virtual-tour.html#"}]},{"guid":"d69617b0-6f48-4074-8122-362496298b21","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":342,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.257746,"lon":-96.010797},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Nebraska at Omaha","alternates":{"ceeb":"6420","ipeds":"181394"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d69617b0-6f48-4074-8122-362496298b21","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"OMAHA, NE","name":"University of Nebraska at Omaha","parentGUIDs":{"college":"c2731dfa-36e9-438a-b5a1-5b5a783f9140","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"13e8e978-b0a7-4879-9c1d-ed3a7eb8ac83","gradSchool":"3eaebf3b-1aa7-4ac9-8109-d7d54436adf4","metroArea":"64d4c77b-cc61-4ea2-b755-4e558c57b8fb","parent":"c2731dfa-36e9-438a-b5a1-5b5a783f9140","state":"d7e00067-2e9a-4b88-bbaa-3243024384e0","town":"e04ed8c1-bffd-4289-a7ae-2d5e47ec6ef7","zipCode":"81a5ed6b-15fe-4ac3-8be9-f9a8fff3ae49"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Nebraska at Omaha","tagline":["4 Year","OMAHA, NE"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska-at-omaha","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8592366090257275},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12973},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"840-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Though I have had a few proffesors that have been dificult to work with and get in contact with, I have also had a lot of amazing proffesors and classes that make up for it.

However, like any transfer experience, adjusting to a new campus culture and forming connections may take time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-12T18:13:42.246197Z","guid":"3f1c6602-1c82-46d4-8037-a0dc2aac472b","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.4115988,40.1999048,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.4115988,40.1999048,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e59eeea2-ff89-471d-a876-4975fd577a91","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7243189202699325,"count":4001},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://bsu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/visit-ball-state"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ball-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=ball-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://bsu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/visit-ball-state"}]},{"guid":"48d72fb8-4653-464c-b8c0-9abf7155081a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":350,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":31.7996831,"lon":-85.9598422},"entity":{"abbreviation":"TROY","alternates":{"ceeb":"1738","ipeds":"102368"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"48d72fb8-4653-464c-b8c0-9abf7155081a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"TROY, AL","name":"Troy University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2dc4f3ed-85d1-4904-82a2-0ee82c9270f1","gradSchool":"18ea1dd6-ff9c-421b-b63e-1d0828384b20","onlineChild":"8b15bdba-b984-4f33-96c6-bf679606668e","state":"bcace3a7-dc8b-437b-a107-4499869a449a","town":"2e394e5f-c7f7-4500-9219-561d85879360","zipCode":"27a8c557-a9bb-46b2-8d4f-04536c1ed2fd"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"TROY","tagline":["4 Year","TROY, AL"],"type":"College","url":"troy-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9484008528784649},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13187},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"950-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"The Phenix City, AL Campus at Troy University is near Ft Benning Army Base making it a great  opportunity to learn with a diverse group of younger and older people; recent High school graduates, career professionals continuing education, and meet people from across the USA who are also military service members continuing education or recently retired.

I absolutely have loved my time here at Loyola so far. I have made countless friends from all over the country and the campus is a perfect size where it is just big enough that it is not claustrophobic, but you consistently run into familiar faces. Most dorms are quite nice compared to some bigger school's dorms I've visited. With the city being so close and the lake right outside your door, you will always be able to find something to do in your free time and take advantage of northside Chicago. The academics are rigorous and for the most part, exceed expectation. I have made some really great connections with professors outside of academics and are therefore a lot of opportunities to network. However, some STEM departments and curriculum do not hold your hand and are brutally difficult for few good reasons making your GPA something to commit firmly to if choosing a STEM major. I also really wish we had football.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-05T03:37:40.891977Z","guid":"3bfc93c9-7fec-4a4f-a171-8e120894a3c0","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9ad4d96f61d0415e9e925d7027a876b981f90abd","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/22fccd04539ca0e2200794d344779ceb1133780e","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51476235adf2738ed15e1106e9f7b4d7989f68a2","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/785ba83bbdabef97bdcf45d251e4d47fc1024647"},"guid":"bf570f3b-5f67-4211-ba39-a1069dd443bb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-08-18T21:58:00.982424Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1e0a75a1c771146273440f715dad28ca3570d7f1"},"guid":"81af1bcb-106f-4003-ad4c-44e56f4216cc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-08-18T21:59:30.436486Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.657399,41.999161,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.657399,41.999161,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"9590e2c7-0d79-4232-b602-87a3ca436a7b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/25ebab4d26e45cbc2eb64bcf251c37e9ad1743df","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fa1bbcb372caa7315d20f3b1f4178da5696db671"},"guid":"397b75c9-6ae0-4495-8838-87f8c214d649","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-18T23:06:36.08579Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.677115987460815,"count":3190},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.luc.edu/undergrad/#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/loyola-university-chicago/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=loyola-university-chicago"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.luc.edu/undergrad/#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"683b3026-92d9-4382-bc68-53ed6ecdb680","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":354,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.55745,"lon":-121.42194},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Sac State","alternates":{"ceeb":"4671","ipeds":"110617"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"683b3026-92d9-4382-bc68-53ed6ecdb680","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"SACRAMENTO, CA","name":"California State University - Sacramento","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"34c47955-2818-44dc-ae71-02a1449da9db","gradSchool":"37c2595c-208d-4928-962a-e20b1bb9e5a3","metroArea":"9fff7676-c5e4-4d3c-b03a-d08d5fcf8971","neighborhood":"4c1f141c-8f10-4a7b-ae0d-0e419d034862","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"e3af1ab3-d1e0-445b-9fbf-b08e41b6afb0","zipCode":"63801b95-decc-4029-9a17-dbcaea43ba18"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Sacramento State","tagline":["4 Year","SACRAMENTO, CA"],"type":"College","url":"california-state-university-sacramento","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.932069947776547},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":11596},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"930-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I enjoyed my experience at Sac State tremendously! The campus is well taken care of, the environment is very calm and plenty of great places to study between outdoor and indoor spaces. All of the professors I encountered were helpful and interested in helping you in your learning experience. Class sizes are relatively small 25-40 students, so you have the opportunity to get to know your classmates as well as your professor. Sporting events are always fun to attend whether it is football, basketball, or baseball. The party scene is not super huge but there are a lot of good bars and places downtown. Campus is safe and they are great at handling situations and alerting students about what is happening. Campus police is proactive is you need help and they have the blue light system as well.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-07T20:35:22.219418Z","guid":"18a3e736-8dec-44fa-adff-99c3e90043b1","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.42194,38.55745,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.42194,38.55745,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"2d4019ef-43df-493c-bd19-f9649c9c05e3","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.741246585547554,"count":4027},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university-sacramento/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-state-university-sacramento"}]},{"guid":"a0f32e0b-7896-407d-ab7c-b96ffe35d307","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":355,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.836091,"lon":-77.234982},"entity":{"abbreviation":"GBC","alternates":{"ceeb":"2275","ipeds":"212674"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"a0f32e0b-7896-407d-ab7c-b96ffe35d307","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"GETTYSBURG, PA","name":"Gettysburg College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e9f31252-0d11-4c2b-a540-c5d6657b9d71","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"4e3fc5f5-dcdb-48b1-b116-12837c7a0648","zipCode":"54cc2b62-c295-4c2c-be31-2b50f88a0f03"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Gettysburg","tagline":["4 Year","GETTYSBURG, PA"],"type":"College","url":"gettysburg-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5631469979296067},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33882},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1350-1440"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I like that there are many international students studying here.

The professors are mostly highly qualified individuals, based on my personal experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-03T18:09:24.247744Z","guid":"7f389653-acc5-4bc0-a72f-1a1aec91436e","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c46538571b29eadc831472b006895e87a3980c5","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dcd2d451a9e9b398e0dbfd3c39e1de3dc1679443","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8bd7930f8c681bc2a9e7f8648fd0f63f1805a07b","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e3da0513a72c2b0d1a4251152f888ca10ef46bd3"},"guid":"9fe362d8-5b06-4b14-aa73-f2af2acd8b83","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-01-25T14:58:24.403645Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3feb262dbeb6b491513a15583b9f1c59f938c1e7"},"guid":"484809dc-488d-48ba-9f8b-456537592af7","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-07T14:11:48.822905Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.4298,38.4224,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.4298,38.4224,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"474b5091-e25c-4969-853a-7323d4c8009c","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eb4efc2ed1e3d69cfbd574895f23c62a51f6c208","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d197ae178e27882fcd7e3d705b1d954e0b0aab9"},"guid":"92c23284-efdb-4e14-99bd-667cecdb5b14","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-13T15:02:07.357661Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6856796116504853,"count":1648},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsf5MphHSWA"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marshall-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=marshall-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsf5MphHSWA"}]},{"guid":"43f83452-af7a-4ad7-8ab5-5d65620a77f3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":358,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":27.384925,"lon":-82.55858},"entity":{"abbreviation":"NCF","alternates":{"ceeb":"5506","ipeds":"262129"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"43f83452-af7a-4ad7-8ab5-5d65620a77f3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SARASOTA, FL","name":"New College of Florida","parentGUIDs":{"college":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d77415e7-233a-444a-a0d1-283dd5087512","gradSchool":"42285c85-d5a1-4c40-80c8-43e0b8e7522e","parent":"7246b73a-5dd5-47da-b96e-6f2c5e17a446","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","town":"3054b7f8-2d34-4718-8eca-2a9c24c023f0","zipCode":"dbf043b7-7eaf-4770-a45f-6f4e4ebd55b5"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"New College","tagline":["4 Year","SARASOTA, FL"],"type":"College","url":"new-college-of-florida","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7540983606557377},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10496},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1110-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"While I love attending New College, the new administrators do not care much for the opinions and desires of students. My first year was a fantastic time, where students all used to hang out and connect through events that would encourage socialization. There's a ton of resources to help maintain the health, wellness, and financial stability of students. Currently, I cannot speak on the state of the food offered since we just signed on with a new cafeteria company. However, in the past, the food was adequate and offered a diverse range of options. The athletics program isn't great since it has only recently been established and doesn't have a strong foundation, so if you're looking to come to New College to play sports, it probably isn't worth it. The college has also recently cut down on the wide range of housing options, leaving some students in hotels or cramped dorms or the USF campus, if not off campus entirely. The parties we have also tend to be smaller than wide scale frat ones.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-07-17T15:45:54.832149Z","guid":"1e2df488-6476-468f-a27a-5182cecb9813","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/11a297f6ae359efc9cebef1ca3cd87861d8c3545","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e5855c6f21dfc2826dc2fe3f16e6c27624ea76b","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4b70130f306c6a28e49ca1cfc49a68b60cb4abaf","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/697801f2daa660f02802020be49b3840871db914"},"guid":"42764187-2262-45e3-a424-8a86d975ca69","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-18T17:55:32.772584Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a66b7ac1c84d352a79b53606050e9a8509319bd3"},"guid":"ff6cd284-86f6-477f-ab18-8b8d481654cc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-27T19:14:37.742015Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.55858,27.384925,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.55858,27.384925,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"1408877a-7947-41f8-8ee4-8606f654346c","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eb50821f9ef59c16e4ad5d453bfa66480d43badf","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/59e2e20dce0c025d9df8b7b430bdbcacb262051f"},"guid":"5de10bc0-f017-46f3-ad28-6b0012f2f87c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-27T18:52:58.59483Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.476987447698745,"count":478},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youtu.be/B17k3VQOitg"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/new-college-of-florida/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=new-college-of-florida"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youtu.be/B17k3VQOitg"}]},{"guid":"6504f1ee-d47c-44e5-a611-cf344b3effb9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":359,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":45.450547,"lon":-122.672478},"entity":{"abbreviation":"L&C","alternates":{"ceeb":"4384","ipeds":"209056"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6504f1ee-d47c-44e5-a611-cf344b3effb9","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"PORTLAND, OR","name":"Lewis & Clark College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"373aa912-2a11-481b-a647-5c09c5bb1e96","gradSchool":"28116cf2-8f03-471b-9a1a-cc7c7046187b","metroArea":"bbed0281-ada4-4dc2-9062-eb63a8a7ba53","neighborhood":"ab096c49-42c5-41cd-8df8-d364f0d2931c","state":"bb5bef7b-e5b0-48bd-bb7f-ea89dc2109e9","town":"12ef2269-431e-407b-a25d-17c1c6aa451d","zipCode":"4d622594-4ff6-4b4e-b962-9d943d4a80f2"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Lewis & Clark","tagline":["4 Year","PORTLAND, OR"],"type":"College","url":"lewis-and-clark-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6858772324778628},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":35832},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1260-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love LC. I’m a junior here rn and this place is Portland embodied in a school. This school is full of very unique, wonderful humans. Students: mostly women, LOTS of trans/non-binary, seriously 85%+ of the school is LGBTQ+. Wonderfully accepting place of everyone who is a kind good hearted person. That being said, if u are a bigot, if u are mean, if u judge—stay tf out of our school. You will regret coming here if you’re not accepting of the unique backgrounds this campus has to offer. The abroad programs are fantastic, scholarships are solid (though the school is fairly underfunded). The food is nice though plenty still complain: extensive vegan options and limited entree stuff, but an outlandishly good dessert/bakery section for all 3 meals of the day. The campus is absolutely beautiful (ranked ~7th US). Party scene is great, and though no one pressures you to smoke, but there’s a LOT of weed on campus. Academics and dorms are both pretty solid.

Do be aware that while it is on an island, UH is still kind of a city school-- Honolulu, while gorgeous, is very much so urban instead of the luscious greenery and unending beach that some students are expecting. There is also a culture that needs to be understood/accepted on the island. It's a double-edged sword: be prepared to be called out on your ignorance at some point for something, but also, closed-minded people tend not to do well/last on the island. So, while you may need to adjust your own thinking sometimes, you will also be surrounded and supported by people going through the same thing. If you love and respect the island, it will love and respect you right back. Truly. \n\nPartying is not a big thing here at all, so do not expect that. There are plenty of social outings (specifically those outdoor/with physical activity), so lots to do, but usually not at a frat house...instead, we hang out at a beach.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-10T23:00:56.740264Z","guid":"8d2c4742-79e6-4376-aa54-29d26615c288","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/75bb7a1143adc3dbcd6fbd1f51462ff6f32fa698","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8bbf644153b8e127a0a5a9c4505a6cbc10208dd4","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/648608d5a25c0016d147af54402580ad8779291a","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68d8cbeb7cd01b48a22d868593b8f2c7e71c0ba4"},"guid":"347b5b0a-e3b7-4ff9-80c4-bde00d3b3474","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-07-26T19:04:34.672535Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e89f7286-4854-4d7e-9b64-862d95f60044","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.53529187333079,"count":2621},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/hawaiimanoa"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-manoa/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-hawaii-at-manoa"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/hawaiimanoa"}]},{"guid":"27892b90-4d52-46f2-a1c4-0b85c677129e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":364,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.036943,"lon":-88.022718},"entity":{"abbreviation":"WLC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1513","ipeds":"240338"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"27892b90-4d52-46f2-a1c4-0b85c677129e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MILWAUKEE, WI","name":"Wisconsin Lutheran College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"8b295479-c31f-47a9-83b8-94b2100e2832","gradSchool":"52d43d76-007b-4a1c-897e-917e9de09038","metroArea":"3940b781-a9f6-4333-b607-6a6367e6af44","neighborhood":"4e0700cc-696a-4942-b0b4-79f0acadecfd","state":"963a1085-efe7-45f5-81ee-d2bbf82a907c","town":"54947c4e-5a01-41c7-b49e-6a99a2fefdc5","zipCode":"54cea862-867e-479f-b878-f1b1920abc27"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Wisconsin Lutheran","tagline":["4 Year","MILWAUKEE, WI"],"type":"College","url":"wisconsin-lutheran-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9382632293080054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":22682},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1000-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I know that Wisconsin Lutheran College is where I am meant to be.

I am on a sports team and on that team I feel as though I am part of a family. Centre puts a lot of attention into their athletics and we are able to thrive. Campus food has improved drastically since the hiring of Chef Desmond and Einstein's Bagels is always consistent. The campus is small enough to walk across in fifteen minutes from one end to another and the population is small enough that you can recognize a lot of people, but still be able to meet new people in your classes every semester.

Everyone here radiates a positive energy that makes it a great place to be. If you're stressed or struggling, there are plenty of resources available to help students navigate their challenges throughout the semester. The diversity on campus is another highlight, as students come from a wide range of backgrounds, including international ones. It’s inspiring to learn from and connect with people from all walks of life.\n\nThe small campus size makes it easy to get to classes, and the smaller class sizes allow for more meaningful relationships with professors almost on a friendship level. The beauty of the campus itself stands out, as my sister, who attends here, showed me its charm. While my overall experience has been very pleasant so far, I would love to see improvements in campus meals and more events that enhance student life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-20T21:31:04.255336Z","guid":"8621ca2c-b8be-4de4-931e-e5d13e093436","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a9f479ee-0db8-4834-8107-a48ba2167772","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.746206896551724,"count":725},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas-texas/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-st-thomas-texas"}]},{"guid":"d04f359a-5b5a-4a96-8459-0b6a0d0d7c21","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":368,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.800929,"lon":-76.192844},"entity":{"abbreviation":"RU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4452","ipeds":"231651"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d04f359a-5b5a-4a96-8459-0b6a0d0d7c21","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"VIRGINIA BEACH, VA","name":"Regent University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"9c83cf1e-c696-4175-b19b-aff3996ded59","gradSchool":"11847a77-85fe-4c68-9061-77f9ae7d7714","metroArea":"c7789904-7e54-43f1-ad0c-fbcf37770ecc","onlineChild":"97c2a53a-e384-4b77-8b4f-7790254eba83","state":"4feeaf03-3715-4319-bdb1-619871879d68","town":"6d62e103-a888-4918-9850-78d9a4ffd43d","zipCode":"396a79cb-95a0-4fe9-b241-79763b8f225d"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Regent","tagline":["4 Year","VIRGINIA BEACH, VA"],"type":"College","url":"regent-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.3233652883102017},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17341},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1030-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"As a graduate student at Regent University, it has been a rewarding experience with respect to meeting the Dean of the University online, access to the officials for COGS, the bookstore that is online, reading all of the course material and the courses for the Graduate Degree.  I have attended virtual meetings to meet other students and was with a lot of enthusiastic professionals that are a part of the meetings. I hope to attend these virtual meetings through the entire Graduate studies.  The Regent University has a website to access career sections, it is very easy to navigate through and has extremely interesting job postings.  Regents has a virtual meeting program for spiritual guidance through their Life Coaches, then I found they offer one on one virtual meetings as appointments for classroom guidance, study guidance, scheduling management, and I am looking forward to attending these one on one meetings.

As well as the growing sports teams, going to amazing football games in the fall followed by a thrilling hockey game in the winter. As much I as I loved the campus,  I would like to see it's growth especially in such a bustling town as Edmond, OK.

There isn't a lot I would like to see change other than the meal plans. They are expensive for most college students to afford even the lowest costing one. It is required to have a meal plan as a freshman living on campus. I have written a couple papers on that topic in my writing and literature class and have done some research and surveys about it. However, other than that I have really enjoyed my time here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-13T22:11:28.624164Z","guid":"b8c7a5d6-0249-419a-a35a-05749216001d","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/664c633bd04227e3bd6c69d4e42bbaa830ec65bd","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1107011844a3b74c83b7423328bd539e9e6b3584","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/120ae6aabf6f5a4df0d1ccfc80e7f9873241626f","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/999f12b7532b43cb2fef0c23c76191b388cb5b99"},"guid":"1a9899a9-e745-47d7-9022-8e33d390394a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-24T19:22:32.573894Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/845102a0f993ab59d02b1354836664c760acd4f2"},"guid":"02fe553d-ae7b-45fb-916c-5c4e253ac189","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-04-19T16:39:06.422764Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.205789,43.604403,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.205789,43.604403,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"4a38e942-8793-473c-acf9-2b37c95acd5f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/33c190be9f5e247ded53803ba57159af29acabab","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efc11889ea242050f087e98e8b5a27f832d5a097"},"guid":"42191e8e-b65c-4f6e-89cc-7bbf43527e05","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-10T14:32:40.85952Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7194787379972567,"count":2916},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://maps.boisestate.edu/?id=715#!t/2979:1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/boise-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=boise-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://maps.boisestate.edu/?id=715#!t/2979:1"}]},{"guid":"3bd96e46-a63c-4585-ba02-796f127f4cef","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":372,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.97588,"lon":-117.331098},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UCR","alternates":{"ceeb":"4839","ipeds":"110671"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"3bd96e46-a63c-4585-ba02-796f127f4cef","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"RIVERSIDE, CA","name":"University of California - Riverside","parentGUIDs":{"college":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"41bae1d9-45de-42cc-bd2a-8f6adc168718","gradSchool":"313f089c-c17f-4b7a-8567-411ed4d1d751","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","neighborhood":"ba5a43d3-9ea0-4198-94bc-370f73b1d19e","parent":"712c3a5f-2747-4b3d-941b-d4f1ceb3d6b9","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"22743c73-c8c3-4a76-b842-3abd75864d26","zipCode":"20006e89-41e4-44a5-a140-7c5ff49405b4"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UC Riverside","tagline":["4 Year","RIVERSIDE, CA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-california-riverside","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6869228096483367},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14487},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1080-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"UC Riverside is known for its diverse student body, strong research opportunities, and scenic campus. Students appreciate the supportive, tight-knit community and personalized attention from professors due to the university's size. The campus is relatively affordable compared to other UC schools, making it an attractive option for many. Additionally, UCR excels in fields like environmental science, biology, and engineering, with students often praising the accessibility of faculty. However, there are areas that could be improved. Some students feel that certain campus facilities, such as dorms and classrooms, could use modernization or renovation. There's also a demand for more study spaces, particularly during busy times. Transportation options could be expanded, as some students find it challenging to navigate without a car.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-27T21:02:53.481833Z","guid":"8ce0e111-83d0-483b-86b7-ac9f5ac19d34","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d243b396774bd1c7f74f8e6b90a409e586c118b3","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d23d75d84417305dac96717c2209d75c9b607d5a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e2aaba205700905c4f482e5e0c6b48fb8aceff79","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/82b9685ad5c69f8b20d6087e4193e63dad0fe5f0"},"guid":"a56cd4c6-657a-49c8-9269-ae3503a58e8a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-11-09T19:55:52.565103Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"53ac0d7c-ae8a-45fa-b1a7-dcac06d6c57f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.662204724409449,"count":3810},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youtu.be/X3sl2rmGmeY?si=-MXijtB_FJIK9nI2"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california-riverside/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-california-riverside"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youtu.be/X3sl2rmGmeY?si=-MXijtB_FJIK9nI2"}]},{"guid":"5915ff34-54d5-4faa-975c-bb603b60ca3d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":373,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.288383,"lon":-77.859781},"entity":{"abbreviation":"APUS","alternates":{"ceeb":"6000","ipeds":"449339"},"character":"4 Year (Online)","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"Online College","guid":"5915ff34-54d5-4faa-975c-bb603b60ca3d","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"American Public University System","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","gradSchool":"b669b799-9e80-41b1-a4fc-15b908911bd3","state":"f0d7046d-0e9b-4ad0-8104-5958adfb5a80"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"APUS","tagline":["4 Year (Online)"],"type":"College","url":"american-public-university-system","variation":2},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":11172},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Well, At first, everything was going smoothly, and I was getting it all together to begin my career in psychology, but then translations from one advisor to another kinda screwed things up, and now I am waiting to get it all back to running smoothly.

I love the close-knit community, the faith-based learning environment, and the opportunities to grow both academically and personally. Being a cheerleader has been a highlight, especially performing at the Homecoming pep rally and celebrating our big win. My Old Testament class also stood out, allowing me to creatively engage with Scripture through projects like a podcast.\n\nHowever, challenges like falling behind due to illness taught me resilience and time management. I would love to see more resources for students facing setbacks and additional hands-on learning opportunities in my major.\n\nOverall, Belhaven has shaped me in so many ways. It is a place where I have grown in my faith, built lasting friendships, and discovered new passions.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-10T18:57:41.527184Z","guid":"b22b9724-7b27-434c-bcda-e0cd724cb3d0","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/64a9ab63c183ed5a1a50003323a72d92c288f237","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f7c531b31f9bc5fad09c38cfbc695a82c75bde59","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f4b2a99ceaa1ad729e9695b42c1499fb0b35566","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4159714291c90d806dcbdb3af5d56cf89a076e09"},"guid":"ea279d70-e5f2-4a84-903b-7e4993a3f9fb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-03T18:25:42.087719Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/405f0db7f5ef27d90ad9e5d4e101cd72f8af52e5"},"guid":"e6fecff8-31af-4383-b6a4-6e1371432a88","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:11:33.642362Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.169228,32.318415,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.169228,32.318415,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"01579f0d-7f62-445b-8627-9b9fcc51a64b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a31720e1abe71fee7522eaa1ac422951e42d3ba6","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3173d7cc38411a0625b38129ec4d71fca76a9995"},"guid":"49983558-8f16-4a7a-bf00-eda40f5716fa","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-28T16:48:47.172947Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.040816326530612,"count":490},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.belhaven.edu/university-life/virtual-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/belhaven-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=belhaven-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.belhaven.edu/university-life/virtual-tour/"}]},{"guid":"d7ef5572-b6f3-432b-b02e-d3c3d559201c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":376,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.429009,"lon":-119.087141},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Thomas Aquinas","alternates":{"ceeb":"4828","ipeds":"124292"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d7ef5572-b6f3-432b-b02e-d3c3d559201c","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"SANTA PAULA, CA","name":"Thomas Aquinas College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2a5a8c4b-1572-4c4c-afbf-720a1c7fe7b9","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","zipCode":"86499288-0848-468d-971a-59f45657c808"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Thomas Aquinas","tagline":["4 Year","SANTA PAULA, CA"],"type":"College","url":"thomas-aquinas-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8473282442748091},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24217},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1220-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"So far I have had an excellent experience at Thomas Aquinas College. The school greatly cares for its students by providing an environment which facilitates the academic, spiritual, and social health of the student. The school also provides financial aid opportunities such as work study programs that help students be able to afford their education regardless of their financial status. The academics are rigorous and thought-provoking. There are many resources for one's spiritual well-being such as on campus chaplains, a beautiful chapel, and many masses every day. The program could change by being less concerned with the discussion method. The discussion method innately favors certain personalities more than others, putting certain students, such as myself, at a great disadvantage. The school evidently favors those who are vigorous participants in class and looks down on the more reserved students, who due to their personality, struggle to participate as much as their fellow classmates.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-07T22:44:41.471483Z","guid":"ceeb545e-919b-4b44-a960-84f211baf45f","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.087141,34.429009,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.087141,34.429009,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e08b95f3-5642-42cf-8979-fd310e1bde55","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.48,"count":50},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/thomas-aquinas-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=thomas-aquinas-college"}]},{"guid":"266c4764-1afe-4dab-8f03-b48c7a3cfa57","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":377,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.844064,"lon":-71.43792},"entity":{"abbreviation":"PC","alternates":{"ceeb":"3693","ipeds":"217402"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"266c4764-1afe-4dab-8f03-b48c7a3cfa57","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PROVIDENCE, RI","name":"Providence College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c39ba72c-9167-458a-b313-8214603fab2a","gradSchool":"823dffda-8c2f-4a0f-9c90-d18827faf215","metroArea":"260eca0f-67e4-4247-a1e8-89d297c15747","neighborhood":"3227833c-b51c-4048-87e0-30f4cde73aa4","state":"b90321a2-492c-48a7-a36e-86fd6e8e3254","town":"97545f3d-c1b8-4546-982c-ddfe0773b640","zipCode":"be37baab-adde-44f4-85df-e82de33e8e01"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Providence","tagline":["4 Year","PROVIDENCE, RI"],"type":"College","url":"providence-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5278102255368856},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":43970},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1260-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Providence College, especially the Civ program, which has greatly deepened my understanding of history and religion.

There are plenty of clubs and events available on campus and even more opportunities to meet like minded students. The campus is beautiful, located in Brooklyn with old buildings that remain functional but still hold their historical value.

It’s not too big and every building is within walking distance of each other. The library has bookable study spaces which I take frequent advantage of and safety has never been an issue for me. There are lots of on-campus activities and I love the idea of having a free period to interact with events on campus as I never experienced this in my community college before transferring. Professors are very interactive and genuinely want to see you pass their classes, every bathroom I’ve walked into is clean and shiny so I have no complaints. Another plus to going here is that they offer scholarships for study abroad programs, all you have to do is apply and you may get approved for a 3,000 scholarship, which basically covers the full cost. Studying abroad has never been an option for me as I have financial struggles but thanks to the many scholarships offered I can start to plan for it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-05T17:44:03.364672Z","guid":"d59c22ee-1450-4106-9393-645c5592b35c","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51502a51f2718b918ebdc30c934d6bfe65ccd553","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3c38410dd93d58a378ca035d896a5cfa00fb6857","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b703326129868a0b2d1ce6c5242fc2af6192eef2","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ccc09b74b0fddd218ec02021a3ad9fbd70ce4728"},"guid":"7f3103b6-49f9-4319-bcc5-229417da1ad4","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-23T18:59:11.953048Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f84d111f5deeb7e930ba71c0734572a6e3a8f8a4"},"guid":"3694189a-90ed-403b-a12c-4f0799d5cd66","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.12318259999999,39.9475461,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.12318259999999,39.9475461,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"b3bfd919-9823-4693-b2a2-88aa7bf2ecb4","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a4c2be434ce75046dbb0e99d8384f851ecd89e5","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7f5174d8d27601479dad1a7e9785b1a71e6f9dd"},"guid":"5dc8bf5f-c671-4333-974a-e5980d3b88c5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5556844547563804,"count":862},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://visitour.io/rutgers-university-camden"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rutgers-universitycamden/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=rutgers-universitycamden"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://visitour.io/rutgers-university-camden"}]},{"guid":"7f069cf1-b9b5-4146-8022-b81d7fc69e64","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":383,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":31.178616,"lon":-92.414409},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Louisiana State University - Alexandria","alternates":{"ceeb":"1632","ipeds":"159382"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7f069cf1-b9b5-4146-8022-b81d7fc69e64","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"ALEXANDRIA, LA","name":"Louisiana State University - Alexandria","parentGUIDs":{"college":"9cc014a9-3692-4d88-977d-119e2d1cd45d","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"44c07987-663d-407c-9212-d770246fa679","onlineChild":"c54e773f-275c-4a29-8e79-1ee7b96c4e32","parent":"9cc014a9-3692-4d88-977d-119e2d1cd45d","state":"0a52f9a9-fad5-4324-8731-e46e1f299b3a","zipCode":"229fb9e5-0a14-4b30-821d-fe53e2b521b0"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Louisiana State University - Alexandria","tagline":["4 Year","ALEXANDRIA, LA"],"type":"College","url":"louisiana-state-university-alexandria","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.576725025746653},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":7274},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"910-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience has been amazing.

Starting school online until my youngest starts going to school was stressful but each one of my professors have been amazing in helping me and guiding me to completing my courses to the best of my ability. I was not sure how well I would be able to accomplish my future goals but I can confidently say that I have finished my first semester with A's and B's. I absolutely love going to school which is crazy to say since I have been out of school for so long. I love that starting school has allowed me to virtually meet my classmates from all over.

Overall as a first year, I can proudly say that I am a pioneer! I love that TWU isn’t known for a party school but as a resourceful school that cares for their students education! I’ve also been able to attend many fun events like the bingo nights and block party which add to the social life on campus!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-20T23:01:03.977437Z","guid":"fbd87c1a-e59a-4631-b323-9e3b6ac7ee9c","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bc485711e849469338ca256d98cbfa3cec078a69","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/116f082a43f2b0eca7be2690e33a93c678d5123b","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ef9a5e653f1af2134a873d478ad22fec8e1ab2b","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ecdf1f839b8723ad96ec002da3acb4082ff9eaa0"},"guid":"6a531401-5ae3-408f-a455-d37785dbf4a5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-21T15:30:10.548428Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.129088,33.227002,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.129088,33.227002,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"ea1ed0b8-30fd-4713-99af-3b5b497ba291","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8257543561410965,"count":2353},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-womans-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=texas-womans-university"}]},{"guid":"be4957e0-cd7e-4d05-b6ae-79481e1deab3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":391,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.840662,"lon":-86.171791},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Butler","alternates":{"ceeb":"1073","ipeds":"150163"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"be4957e0-cd7e-4d05-b6ae-79481e1deab3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"INDIANAPOLIS, IN","name":"Butler University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"bc31b888-e06f-4e5f-ac83-2e0777a80470","gradSchool":"338bfb0c-b1fc-40e4-942c-a3a10d60b686","metroArea":"01e0bbaf-82b5-47a9-bbf0-fd9574658690","neighborhood":"19c1f649-09cb-4c44-b041-2877d4406a43","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"171db881-bf81-42c4-8d8b-a06b74625380","zipCode":"2793f55b-209c-440e-a220-0939cc589742"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Butler","tagline":["4 Year","INDIANAPOLIS, IN"],"type":"College","url":"butler-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8206334976841476},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":37399},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1110-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Butler University is my home away from home! It is the perfect distance from my hometown that is 2 hours away. The adjustment from living at home to living on campus has been an easy transition as I had a great roommate and living experience my freshman year and again this year living in the sorority house. The class sizes of about 20-30 students is perfect for me as I feel like I can get to know my classmates and I feel comfortable asking professors for help when it is needed. There are lots of resources to get academic help from visiting professors in office hours to asking my sorority sisters for assistance if I am struggling in something. When it comes to campus life, I enjoy the atmosphere of both Butler's football games and basketball games. It is nice to be able to meet up with my friends and walk to a sporting event. When thinking about what I would like to see change is hard because I think Butler has checked off all of my boxes for a school!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-20T18:12:12.51728Z","guid":"58cc210d-1641-4af9-a3de-e86faa53a7a8","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/25b1138024a1409a522a8135eeb185bbbf94ce5c","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/784eb239897726b6ce604f3af2ac58cb5150a85f","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/25b1138024a1409a522a8135eeb185bbbf94ce5c","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5c5c7a3a596cf8dae14d16c9646b1204d3a416cf"},"guid":"a721cdde-c521-4991-8446-64e6caa17623","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.171791,39.840662,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.171791,39.840662,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"9694eacb-815a-4ac0-bd0d-e66bc9973d91","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6545079146593253,"count":1453},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.butler.edu/virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/butler-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=butler-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.butler.edu/virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"f00515e5-098a-4a8e-86b1-959f36b01f1c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":392,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.500326,"lon":-90.552402},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Augustana","alternates":{"ceeb":"1025","ipeds":"143084"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f00515e5-098a-4a8e-86b1-959f36b01f1c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"ROCK ISLAND, IL","name":"Augustana College - Illinois","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"054188c5-e0bb-44d5-b080-80eecc8b2d4a","metroArea":"6cba3b7e-eb44-4d11-b0ba-eec11172c01f","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"8612b77a-5955-4eed-9720-46502a8acdd4","zipCode":"5862fca8-8391-4463-bfb3-0fc1421c001e"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Augustana - Illinois","tagline":["4 Year","ROCK ISLAND, IL"],"type":"College","url":"augustana-college-illinois","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6122038765254846},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24660},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1010-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Hello, everyone!

And the natural areas around campus are gorgeous, especially in the fall.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2021-06-29T17:50:02.943086Z","guid":"ddaa4160-d529-4067-b496-26f3502b7440","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92832fa98b72a897fce6fbd3caf9b5a0686b8e58","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dedc053a704390feb923bc04dff5ab654aa1bfc5","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ae23bb82511451fa6c4332a9691022d128561915","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b0550b093b11dcf5c9074f335c74b1924e170222"},"guid":"1b164181-608d-4fd4-8cd4-0e59c8dc063b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-03T04:07:45.327585Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/290356566f3ca6b2cd2cfe23a0a3cb613d7a4d34"},"guid":"aa75d6dc-d81d-44ce-8240-412563923b73","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:23:49.303186Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"16ec44a2-04ef-45cb-8f0e-e6156ea74488","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a1e55d56ba2f16c6e5dbb968ecf2e3885215d73","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/21c279412a1d957ed1f246ec3954f275dea7f4b4"},"guid":"4ed298f6-cdcc-4d7e-9e7c-849e31ff478d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-03T03:51:26.7634Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7151079136690646,"count":695},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.oberlin.edu/admissions-and-aid/visit-and-connect/virtual-programming"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oberlin-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=oberlin-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.oberlin.edu/admissions-and-aid/visit-and-connect/virtual-programming"}]},{"guid":"6b672a49-4ae8-42e8-9cb5-f78421fb6d78","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":395,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":46.012164,"lon":-112.557},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Montana Tech","alternates":{"ceeb":"4487","ipeds":"180416"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6b672a49-4ae8-42e8-9cb5-f78421fb6d78","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"BUTTE, MT","name":"Montana Technological University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"cc1f54fa-d783-42ec-9abb-33c24f0e1164","gradSchool":"713a7ef0-ad26-4673-9808-5ab56ba27f14","state":"26ba29c1-4a58-421e-9dd6-0a74be693f78","town":"4d318fa7-e74b-47a5-a8a8-9056c0c2d108","zipCode":"7298dc01-8ab1-4493-84d4-f0c48b1fbdaa"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Montana Tech","tagline":["4 Year","BUTTE, MT"],"type":"College","url":"montana-technological-university","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8947068867387592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":16045},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1050-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"At Montana technological university, all professors are great and explain things really well in class.

When the school year first started I felt very lonely and homesick. It was a really wild change from living at home and only going to school  in the morning to living on campus all day. Having a time change of an hour later was also a big change for me because my days felt really long. The community on campus felt like everyone was in their own thing and making friends has been hard for me. The semester’s have gone by so fast that I can’t believe the school year is almost over, everything was such a new experience not having all the people I was already close with be in school with me. The drives home where very tedious but worth it because it was really exciting to see my siblings happy to have me at home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-28T07:01:06.648112Z","guid":"eb77c91a-9d8a-4c5c-8f53-4126223a55a9","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9169e20c314d8846e6dc72a471c7d12547bdf516.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dc6e23d18b183d95c912d4e01bcd64dc796472b8.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9169e20c314d8846e6dc72a471c7d12547bdf516.jpg"},"guid":"8b684892-0566-40ce-a0a2-cd70328670ed","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.870018,35.166166,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.870018,35.166166,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"617d4f37-1514-48fc-b7a8-bc1d102e6d81","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8408668730650155,"count":1615},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lee-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=lee-university"}]},{"guid":"641d33dd-e6a1-453a-a16b-ddde53dbe00c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":399,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.475,"lon":-73.2023},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UVM","alternates":{"ceeb":"3920","ipeds":"231174"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"641d33dd-e6a1-453a-a16b-ddde53dbe00c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"BURLINGTON, VT","name":"University of Vermont","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"806640e3-5276-4d53-aac8-ed16c46c97e2","gradSchool":"661f3036-36ff-4b82-8b97-e2956dc4f0f3","neighborhood":"0605a2d4-5887-448e-9813-ee14ffa75f23","state":"b83feca4-a312-4f97-bc94-6c855f6cb0dd","town":"088727fc-743a-41e6-a1e3-47bdcbed74db","zipCode":"d65fb569-7e4c-4c08-8d29-a9239d9c5898"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Vermont","tagline":["4 Year","BURLINGTON, VT"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-vermont","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5978961992656545},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":21849},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1260-1430"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Other","body":"I was enthralled with UVM.

Even though the racial & ethnic diversity was low, I never had any negative racial experiences. Students of color got to come to campus first in an effort to make it easier to connect with people of a similar background, which was nice. During my time, the student body did a lot of advocating for organizational change aiming to increase diversity and LGBTQIA+ acceptance. I had a lovely experience with my professors- the small course sizes led to building great relationships and many research opportunities. I lived on campus all four years (as an RA in campus housing and apartments my last 2 years). The dorms were so fun and I met my best friends (that I still see today) in my freshman hall. There were themed events, Big sister rituals, bonding experiences, campus competitions, and so many more things to look forward to. Food options on campus were decent & the neighborhood was safe. If you want a party, Seattle has a fun nightlife to explore.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-14T00:19:09.583021Z","guid":"ebee8c7c-31cf-4fb5-b189-4c57857de7a5","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/44c2f7e2200fa52dbb3a9fecb4fc63146c50bac9","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/edfa7f4b31445cfd4e4428a8a080a0ad06416cf0","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5d53e0a7cdc30135814e7b5df99bcf2d55bf9c52","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/84d5aa4164861c9a9bafd5a242f049c5eb0c6e54"},"guid":"9c138df9-52fb-44e5-b510-b4ad8524075f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-29T20:21:24.69464Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4edf752836e317437f515424cf78a7cc69182481"},"guid":"79feb2f7-cd53-4544-8137-19ab65b9047e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-05-16T20:21:08.863693Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f6f73345-fe79-41f7-8743-fedcd732b6ca","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbfe0329152ceb75c69741fd60f5b723190d2de0","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5525961926f6470f43dcb41065499e2993a81ebe"},"guid":"cab91125-cc6f-4ccf-83b8-7f77a29bfab2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-30T19:02:27.049104Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.716621253405995,"count":1101},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://spu.edu/undergraduate-admissions/visit/360-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seattle-pacific-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=seattle-pacific-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://spu.edu/undergraduate-admissions/visit/360-tour"}]},{"guid":"cc3a5c8e-c77a-4eba-a48e-576d1871b9c5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":403,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":45.666829,"lon":-111.049918},"entity":{"abbreviation":"MSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4488","ipeds":"180461"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"cc3a5c8e-c77a-4eba-a48e-576d1871b9c5","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"BOZEMAN, MT","name":"Montana State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"1b767a0a-1e6b-499a-a805-8490df473072","gradSchool":"207170cc-3299-4271-8d2e-6033ce2ac7c7","state":"26ba29c1-4a58-421e-9dd6-0a74be693f78","town":"d06b8385-8672-486f-a425-952d38a1c6f3","zipCode":"c4827514-86c1-4049-b79e-80c8131e58bb"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Montana State","tagline":["4 Year","BOZEMAN, MT"],"type":"College","url":"montana-state-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7334286411660099},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17250},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1070-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"MSU is a good school with a lot of opportunities for low income students like myself.

Peoria is not always the best area, but the immediate campus of Bradley feels safe and welcoming.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-05T05:21:27.765797Z","guid":"7c346234-7d35-42b7-95a3-0a520bdb87fb","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c19be4effe48c4c8566e290e1aa6b2c04dd5ef9e","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/02f18fed4f7188ffb6a77f9ddfff223aa5899d2e","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1018867146f9461dcdea7ddf4b24a96eedf063e8","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2213640e9a1a2972832631bcd1f783e4001341ac"},"guid":"c0357471-1d9e-465e-8c10-52945502506f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-03T20:32:29.519523Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/00f1ec9182a431b3384544df3aab2ed24890a683"},"guid":"2157e58d-0d03-48c6-9c35-388cebd24193","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:20:33.942145Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.61462,40.697605,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.61462,40.697605,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d3660fef-5f54-4e34-9f5a-914e90e9740a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6e9ddb68d976f759f7c8e4bdb2479db5fee55250","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbb7dd5f6ecb2eda63dab9a83db2c4820448c1e9"},"guid":"a757c2f8-9f48-4ba7-b3f3-b4ea31380ad6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-13T21:48:10.725545Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.546603475513428,"count":1266},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/60105/?pl=v&message=failed-embed-redirect"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bradley-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=bradley-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/60105/?pl=v&message=failed-embed-redirect"}]},{"guid":"ae22001d-88c2-46aa-8ba6-612846f01024","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":407,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.929916,"lon":-85.587548},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Calvin","alternates":{"ceeb":"1095","ipeds":"169080"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"ae22001d-88c2-46aa-8ba6-612846f01024","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"GRAND RAPIDS, MI","name":"Calvin University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6f608aca-0c19-4cef-b2a7-d57b5cd54a33","gradSchool":"b987c079-bc0a-4174-9a1a-87aeecf96b9d","metroArea":"d9d37159-ea4b-4891-b355-6706b6a9574f","state":"0eb3399d-938d-4c33-807a-6fd72141e1d0","town":"bd3b2399-57c6-4876-8055-60b5d02a3311","zipCode":"901c2018-fc74-49a9-87a7-a0b868b1cf59"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Calvin","tagline":["4 Year","GRAND RAPIDS, MI"],"type":"College","url":"calvin-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7420936504045109},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":25775},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1120-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Calvin University.

They have so many resources and connections to help you thrive in your major/undergrad degree while setting you up for future jobs and graduate programs. They really do care about each and every student and I have enjoyed my time at Calvin University immensely. I'm already sad about the thought of leaving and I'm just a sophomore!

My college experience here has been a unique one that I have genuinely enjoyed and wouldn't trade for anything.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-20T03:29:21.854835Z","guid":"861b72cf-4e09-40a4-b0ca-36160ab8761e","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.418601,33.493305,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.418601,33.493305,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"9a662e33-4bef-4b02-9f07-8a0e06a1d839","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8440111420612815,"count":359},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mississippi-university-for-women/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=mississippi-university-for-women"}]},{"guid":"ddfb1faf-5d26-4433-a964-4c64c7388f8e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":411,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.736489,"lon":-84.162375},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1145","ipeds":"156541"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"ddfb1faf-5d26-4433-a964-4c64c7388f8e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WILLIAMSBURG, KY","name":"University of the Cumberlands","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"55f8483d-ac96-48b8-a3ca-b77cd51611d7","gradSchool":"e540c2f5-2541-4c66-896e-29e85520db6d","onlineChild":"7641619d-64a3-4128-ad63-60b61e1e56f3","state":"27966205-db74-44e6-8d2d-79a4df61742a","town":"51446fb0-b5ac-4726-bec1-cc3acdef6d2b","zipCode":"abfad267-ad12-4f71-8d7d-fc4654e7ed78"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Cumberlands","tagline":["4 Year","WILLIAMSBURG, KY"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-the-cumberlands","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8307291666666666},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14337},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"My experience with the University of the Cumberlands has been overwhelmingly positive.

But overall, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive, and I highly recommend Montclair State University to anyone looking for a supportive and engaging learning environment!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-09T13:14:02.223276Z","guid":"e7de3b6b-a7d4-4224-8eb8-f7c13c30dd54","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0b8c1ece1f5c7e814587c3f61fd22e8e40a20ef5","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f9ff61ddb084db3b1d31272a26dd6abda31f5911","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c8981cd1ec69518f92875cdf0221bdec6b7be23","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/709d942f027bad115df718b84cb272a8cb9fc6f8"},"guid":"880fe18b-188f-470b-9a09-163b745756d2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-25T21:09:55.825116Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/38eca311ea01067664ec6fa24f6ebc64b852a640"},"guid":"75cb4963-944d-4b7e-85b1-a1b60d8c8a24","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-02T18:28:14.167978Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c5dff911-09de-474f-a79b-4f26b6cb7997","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a937a9e40a99b5ea9ff3d55f3f8e9a957f6a0913","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/40ee6f3d8b4dc298eb29724491f18f05ad042875"},"guid":"8cc7aefc-8c10-46e5-bd5d-ad732d9d71d4","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-25T20:45:18.830421Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6022623051054725,"count":3271},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.montclair.edu/admissions/visit-us/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/montclair-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=montclair-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.montclair.edu/admissions/visit-us/"}]},{"guid":"84e95c64-dae6-433c-bd0e-58a67326ea19","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":420,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.679429,"lon":-74.234668},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Kean","alternates":{"ceeb":"2517","ipeds":"185262"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"84e95c64-dae6-433c-bd0e-58a67326ea19","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"UNION, NJ","name":"Kean University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"0bce935a-bca1-4ff0-b900-2addeb033800","gradSchool":"6b1431b4-172b-4fdb-a726-4decd5475a76","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","onlineChild":"4c793424-dd34-4eec-9033-b5ec1e3ca1f8","state":"ed4102c4-b16f-4ccd-8d8b-ccfeb8fa21ea","town":"0a1e9f44-ceaa-4328-b2f5-696fb3b3b756","zipCode":"a25e29cb-219b-48bf-9a99-4d411cc60c5a"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Kean","tagline":["4 Year","UNION, NJ"],"type":"College","url":"kean-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8260371959942775},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10747},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"900-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a second-year student at Kean University, my experience has been enriching and transformative.

First, my professors, dedicated to teaching and guiding all students, even though I am an international student, have helped me a lot and given me extra time to complete my homework. Next is a global office, where I often send my worries about academic problems, the counselors have advised and given me advice so that I know how to solve those academic problems. My advisor, a friend who has accompanied me and understood my situation, Next is the campus life, although not as perfect as I thought, but still gives me the feeling of a home with clubs and cultures mixed. Finally, there is the indispensable cafeteria called market cafeteria, where there are a variety of dishes from Europe to Asia. This is probably one of the places that eases homesickness, the burden of life, and the anxiety of studying. In short, Northeastern State University is a perfect place for me to stick with for my 4-year undergraduate journey.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-25T02:03:24.718389Z","guid":"cd6f5d3b-bb4d-401d-843b-c99283c1f224","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c4ce81b4f738d2fc502f02c2d21f1683c84ee1d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e79f211ec3d94f31de89841e46bbd293fff80eaa.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c4ce81b4f738d2fc502f02c2d21f1683c84ee1d.jpg"},"guid":"830405fd-020a-46b2-a241-677ac52d716c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.9693,35.9213,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.9693,35.9213,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"74856025-28e1-4973-b98f-5a5cbed4845a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6445959104186954,"count":1027},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northeastern-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=northeastern-state-university"}]},{"guid":"6055a367-eb17-4b98-87ba-4747376b0804","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":422,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.615678,"lon":-112.452285},"entity":{"abbreviation":"ERAU - Prescott","alternates":{"ceeb":"4305","ipeds":"104586"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"6055a367-eb17-4b98-87ba-4747376b0804","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"PRESCOTT, AZ","name":"Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University - Prescott","parentGUIDs":{"college":"04f9ab8d-dd5e-427f-acd8-841051062033","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"73df62aa-66fc-4df0-8368-f9128d60d2db","gradSchool":"9b7514a1-e98f-478c-81ed-aa4742ccb9b5","parent":"04f9ab8d-dd5e-427f-acd8-841051062033","state":"26faec1a-8315-44dd-91e6-2437cbec6490","town":"88a1d07b-0dfe-4911-9c09-5b4dc53dd895","zipCode":"32cd1c55-aeae-4665-8394-6ac9e13b964d"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Embry-Riddle - Prescott","tagline":["4 Year","PRESCOTT, AZ"],"type":"College","url":"embry-riddle-aeronautical-university-prescott","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.680394922425952},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":38909},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1170-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"While I haven't gotten to campus yet, I can say my experience thus far getting accepted and going through the process has been amazing.

If you want a campus life, then it’s not for you. If you don’t and you just want to go class and you work full time, it’s a good fit as they offer afternoon/night classes. Also, due to it not being main campus, it has its issues, but the campus in my city getting more attention and applications. So, that might change as it’s getting bigger, which may bring more opportunities and activities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-16T22:12:34.137901Z","guid":"af6db084-33b1-4cc9-818d-47c6abb656bf","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/06468f4768ae996116cb0d80ad442f8fcc004d9f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/96147a83479b91647c5c58af4d1c685bcea78bef.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/06468f4768ae996116cb0d80ad442f8fcc004d9f.jpg"},"guid":"d7fcbf16-a07a-4263-a51f-dc0389877837","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.395287,46.374571,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.395287,46.374571,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"361838c8-d740-472d-8996-c9967d851aa7","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7138810198300285,"count":353},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/heritage-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=heritage-university"}]},{"guid":"b190dc56-ca74-4245-854d-69a2227cae75","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":427,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.980567,"lon":-87.72013},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Northeastern Illinois","alternates":{"ceeb":"1090","ipeds":"147776"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b190dc56-ca74-4245-854d-69a2227cae75","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CHICAGO, IL","name":"Northeastern Illinois University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"7bfb22bd-ca33-4718-905f-26a408664726","gradSchool":"a7b76228-7da6-4fb7-bb5e-00e180e3ca8a","metroArea":"b1fe05c5-1876-422b-81a7-8dfa8da9acfd","neighborhood":"159d2205-1474-411f-b643-81ff637eeb5b","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"33384739-287e-4fab-8d93-0bb2e87603e7","zipCode":"38724a33-6a4a-4396-af68-2e697aace419"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Northeastern Illinois","tagline":["4 Year","CHICAGO, IL"],"type":"College","url":"northeastern-illinois-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6261220825852782},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14262},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"810-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Northeastern Illinois University has provided me with a level of comfort, acceptance, and pride that other educational institutes have not provided.

With no one to guide me, I’ve had to figure out financial aid, class registration, and campus life on my own.

The coursework is demanding, pushing me beyond my comfort zone, but I’m developing strong study habits and building connections. I’ve started exploring organizations and networking opportunities to support my growth. Though the journey isn’t easy, I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

Campus is also incredibly safe, which is such a nice aspect of going to SFU.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-16T21:23:28.253746Z","guid":"764ec410-f7ce-41f2-9036-48135557b908","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/78bcf9bae1041586552c827afac079035d7e2982","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ee9c9827e4c86d542c0d800a64e877bb29ca46e","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7583b3f20d5282c479332c00c8e3579c74ba95ca","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6463dabb30f4d2033f0ef64ddfc37a497bf889a0"},"guid":"bad0caf7-fc87-4c2f-a078-7c91a1f0afa2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-12T00:07:37.260793Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/079a5c0ec1771c50874ee2d5b2fbe497496831fb"},"guid":"43c12b97-5ab1-4590-8ca4-2d14b70f61ce","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:20:26.240245Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.638469,40.502782,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.638469,40.502782,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"73a408d1-1c5c-4aaa-bf4e-90f358de888b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5332294dbc5a626ce91435fd3d40e4d4d1ed362f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f80632c7cf1ca476da818acc2045522df290cdf3"},"guid":"21f3abd5-7d2a-404c-9e88-687d6c1c4d42","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-18T00:58:41.165081Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6496,"count":625},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/62946/143835?pl=v&reff=https://www.francis.edu/&from=embed-js-failed"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-francis-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=saint-francis-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/62946/143835?pl=v&reff=https://www.francis.edu/&from=embed-js-failed"}]},{"guid":"b307df89-aadc-4d83-b6fa-8be14b52a06a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":433,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.728003,"lon":-121.846333},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Chico State","alternates":{"ceeb":"4048","ipeds":"110538"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b307df89-aadc-4d83-b6fa-8be14b52a06a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CHICO, CA","name":"California State University, Chico","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"87364213-1d03-4f22-8f63-eb792d4bc4ef","gradSchool":"fa252ba7-08fb-4fa9-8a4e-1551f1da5686","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"a6905c83-c3b9-475a-9c39-13683700cea5","zipCode":"e8c609fd-ddc2-4761-97e5-1471b1796f73"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Chico State","tagline":["4 Year","CHICO, CA"],"type":"College","url":"california-state-university-chico","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9500396880982397},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":15517},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"970-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"California State University, Chico is known for its strong sense of community, beautiful campus, and supportive faculty.

It’s been a rewarding experience, strengthening our friendship and forming new bonds with like-minded individuals. My first semester was incredibly busy, balancing school with extracurricular activities like the Sports Business Society, Residence Assistance, and Hall Council. Despite the hectic schedule, I maintained a 3.4 GPA, which I’m proud of. These experiences have helped me grow academically and personally, teaching me time management, teamwork, and leadership.

My professors have been great with the exception of one. There are a lot of clubs and organizations to join. The campus is a little dead on the weekends, but there are places to go in town or into Daytona for the day (or night). The food is the one area that needs drastic improvement! There are hardly any options at the main dining hall, often what they do have is of odd combinations, they run out of items, and their are not enough places to get food on the weekends because the hours of the dining locations are so random. Overall, I am happy with my decision to attend Stetson.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-16T15:32:03.636755Z","guid":"10ca7835-f322-4f57-ac41-9bbe4f37c129","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d2a8848084857356625300b442da69adbe9434d2","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/782b3f71d5b89cedfc28f072e96d7c304268b1e5","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0fa52f3ad8e68ec593f5f5690491e2a442518ccb","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0aeb5201c47e5c0e29e7fdf549e5a335b64080ef"},"guid":"296145e7-0745-4581-99e2-b9d0d511a42f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-18T22:24:44.093975Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2aefb04a4c70aeab14517b39281ac1552798d2d"},"guid":"7a34bfbf-fc01-4b30-9eb0-0ddad64362b8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-18T22:51:01.27391Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.301604,29.036295,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.301604,29.036295,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"57fb1fc8-ea5e-4bf2-bc87-f7bc4a0e340b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/408b17e859bf2686f65cff97fa7ca3489bfe4dc7","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/117a5f26324bcc37dc2370684eb7b29d6cbfedc3"},"guid":"41059f14-d7c7-4d80-93f7-ec0582e13bf6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-18T15:54:47.93477Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.740225314777999,"count":1509},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://visit.stetson.edu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/stetson-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=stetson-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://visit.stetson.edu/"}]},{"guid":"a0f566ad-11d3-485b-8879-df105d764754","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":438,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.7550152,"lon":-73.4273672},"entity":{"abbreviation":"FSC","alternates":{"ceeb":"2526","ipeds":"196042"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"a0f566ad-11d3-485b-8879-df105d764754","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"FARMINGDALE, NY","name":"SUNY Farmingdale State College","parentGUIDs":{"college":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"77074972-a093-4f85-b547-9b721027cac7","gradSchool":"3c5efc5c-76f7-49b7-9e4d-5584c892f5cb","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","parent":"f7126eef-eb17-4258-9f82-a4e694ae5ebd","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"0f917126-2b0c-4aa0-8402-0ed057594c4e","zipCode":"6c6fccca-a2e5-4582-a504-68ddc26a55ae"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Farmingdale","tagline":["4 Year","FARMINGDALE, NY"],"type":"College","url":"suny-farmingdale-state-college","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7317149081854964},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":8111},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1000-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Farmingdale State College wasn't my first choice, but it ended up being the perfect fit.

As a parent, I appreciate quality and variety in dining options, and CPP exceeds expectations. The campus eateries offer something for everyone, from grab-and-go snacks for busy students to sit-down meals perfect for unwinding after a long day. Places like Centerpointe Dining Commons are particularly noteworthy, providing an impressive selection of international cuisines, fresh ingredients, and a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe availability of healthy options is another big plus. With a son at homeI understand the importance of balanced nutrition, and it’s comforting to see the university promote wholesome eating habits.

Some professors tend to focus more on talking about their content then genuinely teaching students which makes it hard to follow along in a class. There are some professors, however, that are amazing and go out of their way to make sure that what they are teaching is being understood and is willing to set aside time for students to discuss questions with them as well. Housing at Salisbury University is hit or miss. A friend of mine, my current roommate, had to move rooms because her old dorm room had mold in it. My dorm room's AC unit has not been working since the beginning of the school year but other than that, the buildings themselves are nice and in the cluster style rooms housekeeping cleans the bathrooms every weekday. The dining hall food at Salisbury is not the best and tends to be repetitive however there are plenty of other dining options around campus for students to choose from.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-09T20:44:27.953582Z","guid":"1affe699-d9f3-4d08-9dff-5cd03083da75","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3bbcf5b1ca77dac4d0fcf14783c438db39c7ff27","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6edd7b9d1691cc62721e9b256b7a4af600950121","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/027f8ff5863b853bad7a8ac9c2dfcfdbe79c4660","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6fd017a301b27e95d394b36abeee576f44114843"},"guid":"fd5f9d21-030b-442a-8211-2337d61fcffd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-07T21:06:18.883224Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d629a03164d9ec39bee7fc6332f26d807f9c4bf4"},"guid":"dc875e2a-a816-4587-a0e8-aac8fbfbe45a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-08T18:29:47.692534Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.605705,38.345447,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.605705,38.345447,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"4704bbf0-594e-435d-84f3-78646f97f49d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.572523961661342,"count":1565},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.salisbury.edu/become-a-student/visit-campus.aspx"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/salisbury-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=salisbury-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.salisbury.edu/become-a-student/visit-campus.aspx"}]},{"guid":"b75734e0-c688-4d11-9b8d-8245eac76a78","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":449,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.849139,"lon":-86.362094},"entity":{"abbreviation":"MTSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1466","ipeds":"220978"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b75734e0-c688-4d11-9b8d-8245eac76a78","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"MURFREESBORO, TN","name":"Middle Tennessee State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"1c64688f-a0c4-4a63-b191-540910370feb","gradSchool":"ff4e1873-b235-408c-b960-31de05039dc3","metroArea":"e1ef29cc-a7b5-4031-b1e8-6c90a4b2e50f","onlineChild":"f60e7c63-290d-4832-962c-7d8ad7233f95","state":"eb2a19be-aace-48f2-9508-e8ed89070367","town":"a9296e5d-407f-4de0-b4e6-cd764c64aba7","zipCode":"d178c17d-117c-4acc-9cc7-16fcabffef1c"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Middle Tennessee State","tagline":["4 Year","MURFREESBORO, TN"],"type":"College","url":"middle-tennessee-state-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7254429592788312},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13062},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1020-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall, I really enjoy attending MTSU! It has a really amazing program for my field of study, and I’ve been able to take advantage of some really great opportunities here. However, because MTSU is what people call a “suitcase school,” living on campus can feel isolating at times, and I feel we lack a strong sense of community because of this. That’s not to say there’s no community to be found, we have some really amazing student organizations and plenty of opportunities to engage with fellow students, but when it comes to walking around campus on the weekends, it kind of feels like you’re walking around a ghost town. Even so, I still love MTSU and couldn’t see myself at any other university.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-06T04:57:41.348796Z","guid":"c7f37b35-0722-43ed-a0df-b8d7aea6f507","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/567be815148ae20a2d4bc1fdf46a871136729ec1","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3f85e389df7bcc65700b1c2472f91cd0c06dbfe9","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db762af47554a8064fbdfe2b6012373a5f5efc86","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bf4895c6763e8302324b9fba1710d04f90d976b3"},"guid":"d95a8447-2242-4296-b9ae-281d9f901880","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-16T19:37:25.024256Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.362094,35.849139,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.362094,35.849139,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"41cd60ef-e617-48d6-8fe5-7cf66920c8ae","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6931082981715893,"count":3555},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlz65d1Nmeo&t=1s"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/middle-tennessee-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=middle-tennessee-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlz65d1Nmeo&t=1s"}]},{"guid":"f40f099d-b1ed-4a8f-9551-fab2e3226caf","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":450,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.556723,"lon":-87.338457},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Indiana - Northwest","alternates":{"ceeb":"1338","ipeds":"151360"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f40f099d-b1ed-4a8f-9551-fab2e3226caf","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"GARY, IN","name":"Indiana University - Northwest","parentGUIDs":{"college":"8b4975fe-d2cb-42fb-a8ed-0cca388f666c","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a6f42838-fd17-4000-a7fa-b31d74923294","gradSchool":"81b49565-b0b8-4703-bb93-39874402160d","metroArea":"b1fe05c5-1876-422b-81a7-8dfa8da9acfd","parent":"8b4975fe-d2cb-42fb-a8ed-0cca388f666c","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"44f8d2f1-6e70-4ff3-a7cf-2f5285df7d01","zipCode":"19128b28-b8fd-470b-97f7-ae2df18d12b2"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Indiana - Northwest","tagline":["4 Year","GARY, IN"],"type":"College","url":"indiana-university-northwest","variation":9},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8031331592689295},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":6553},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"950-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Indiana Northwest University has a lot of good people that want you to learn, and they want to help you succeed.

GREAT SCHOOL! For a smaller(ish) school, it is well-known across the country. I now live in Denver and can't tell you how many people make positive comments on the school when I mention it. This school has an amazing social scene if you are into parties and bars. (Please, make sure to keep your priorities straight. So, if you have to stay in on a Saturday to finish a project or study for a Monday xxam, STAY IN). You will have next weekend to have fun drinking. Grades come first! Miami also has an amazing business school. Miami consistently produces great future leaders. Lastly, be cautious of fraternities. Like many schools, there are hazing concerns. So please guys be aware of this when pledging. Don't sacrifice your dignity to get into a certain frat. And girls, be cautious with drinks and who you take back to dorm. We have a sexual assault issue, like every college it seems.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-26T03:01:09.257718Z","guid":"cb3db9ed-6c65-4eff-8ee1-7ec8c8af557a","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2edade9b7a5dd807377b708755740c7bc69202e3","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7183fe5c7e00b3733393673bbc535b630985d042","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f14109c35b42b42788eb601d628436352c986698","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/07e9b61aa9bb161e6b714789c6fd60f524ab7032"},"guid":"34da248a-77e1-4258-ae15-7e8621bcd7a4","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-14T14:29:35.212089Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cee8bc8a3cb02813668fdf531589df2e1d081295"},"guid":"470da450-37c6-4fc8-b90c-85948b0700ca","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:10:04.567174Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.731821,39.509642,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.731821,39.509642,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"293b9f2b-3e8b-45f2-bd5e-5a011e9b558f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/de006ab56c2b5a5c44a85be7a50b4fdfbc44dce9","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f6607842f20576a4628613067ba0076383ef6a1"},"guid":"9a1061d8-8045-43e1-b39e-31a9bbee6946","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-14T13:12:48.955014Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7212553495007135,"count":3505},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://miamioh.edu/visit/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/miami-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=miami-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://miamioh.edu/visit/"}]},{"guid":"e7815197-0633-40dd-b201-c5a0450986b8","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":457,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":27.947225,"lon":-82.465582},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UT","alternates":{"ceeb":"5819","ipeds":"137847"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e7815197-0633-40dd-b201-c5a0450986b8","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"TAMPA, FL","name":"University of Tampa","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"b6946a5f-c3ec-4a02-85df-877a4a9715dc","gradSchool":"daef6c31-f6a6-4eed-8d13-45830be6a69f","metroArea":"22546508-55e2-41c0-8526-6af8dfc6b311","neighborhood":"87cdae58-ac41-4871-b01a-944424088ad5","state":"ec151f4b-fbc6-4a5f-9b8c-205201ee37d8","town":"1c6ad6b6-1042-4bd3-8129-dcb952a49026","zipCode":"bb0d78c9-2d68-4b99-9f9d-42f77c7b3183"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Tampa","tagline":["4 Year","TAMPA, FL"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-tampa","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.26349103907064486},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":34653},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1070-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The housing situation is a struggle, last I heard there was not even enough room to house all the freshman, and renting in Tampa is expensive! The dorms are pretty nice though compared to other campuses! Food on campus is mid, they have Einsteins, Starbucks and Chick-Fil-A but its definitely not the quality you would get off campus. Most professors are cool and more than willing to help students. UTampa offers a good selection of degree options, and switching programs is relatively easy! There are a ton of extracurriculars to do. Significant amount of international students, which is great for diversity because otherwise most of the rest of the student body are from the NE. Safety and location of campus is a big plus! There is tons to do outside of university. Parking on campus was tough when I was a student, the parking garages were always jam packed and student traffic was not always managed efficiently, but I believe they have made some improvements in this regard.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-11T19:08:56.394274Z","guid":"25979481-9875-402a-b1cc-d33b1af942ce","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/693510118bec624b368a2d5f64715213b985bd6e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92de6ad116bfd77e78d6f29c01c6a7e9e2466e96.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/693510118bec624b368a2d5f64715213b985bd6e.jpg"},"guid":"1f6dd1b9-9a74-4519-a2a0-9216907cc355","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3c9948e01aa4e8eb93b60cd0659391abfdb47ac3"},"guid":"ad7ccae9-6122-4b49-9ba2-a95dc57cde5e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:19:29.799146Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.465582,27.947225,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.465582,27.947225,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"2112321f-0869-4dae-8c15-e423c2cf8d8b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.646964856230032,"count":2504},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.ut.edu/about-ut/university-services/office-of-public-information/ut-virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-tampa/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-tampa"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.ut.edu/about-ut/university-services/office-of-public-information/ut-virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"980a3863-f470-469c-b1cb-007918ee35e6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":458,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.920149,"lon":-71.539147},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Bryant","alternates":{"ceeb":"3095","ipeds":"217165"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"980a3863-f470-469c-b1cb-007918ee35e6","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SMITHFIELD, RI","name":"Bryant University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c39ba72c-9167-458a-b313-8214603fab2a","gradSchool":"cf394dc7-1b11-47f2-b93a-a0c89523b485","metroArea":"260eca0f-67e4-4247-a1e8-89d297c15747","state":"b90321a2-492c-48a7-a36e-86fd6e8e3254","town":"bd31c377-17a4-44de-a554-177ead9053ab","zipCode":"c930ea36-8d4d-4054-8701-64ab1c9bf69a"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Bryant","tagline":["4 Year","SMITHFIELD, RI"],"type":"College","url":"bryant-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6880898876404494},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":40361},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1150-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a first-year student at Bryant University, my experience so far has been both exciting and enriching.

However, I think class availability could be improved, especially for required courses, as some fill up quickly. More clinical opportunities for pre-health students would also be beneficial.

While I have primarily focused on my studies and responsibilities outside of school, I have had limited opportunities to engage in social activities on campus. At times, this has made me feel isolated, as I do not have close friends or peers to share my college experience with. However, I deeply appreciate UTEP’s vibrant campus and the opportunities it offers. I only wish I had more chances to explore the campus and build lasting memories with others.\nDespite these challenges, I remain committed to my education and personal growth. I recognize the value of community and support, and I hope to become more involved in campus life. Receiving this scholarship would not only help alleviate financial burdens but also empower me to seek new experiences and connections that will enrich my time at UTEP.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-27T23:13:27.403077Z","guid":"f8aaa5b8-33de-45a8-a237-1e2c80087442","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"98f00546-71eb-4a66-8ac0-17d08ac7fad5","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7407641300915695,"count":3167},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas-el-paso/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-texas-el-paso"}]},{"guid":"2c61d1b3-13b0-45db-87df-f3df02787d3a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":464,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.695954,"lon":-104.964625},"entity":{"abbreviation":"DU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4842","ipeds":"127060"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"2c61d1b3-13b0-45db-87df-f3df02787d3a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"DENVER, CO","name":"University of Denver","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"b9317ae5-0269-456e-9dd7-02836d77c8aa","gradSchool":"2e0bbbfe-197c-429a-aab0-29396663f805","metroArea":"fdadf349-4258-4460-bd53-231e309e5a44","neighborhood":"bb7b77f4-142b-46b3-9a90-2c3d071541d4","state":"128115b8-13f9-4e43-a016-915da57b0729","town":"4b164a67-ba07-47b5-bd05-a40730ead314","zipCode":"5bf12e9f-1549-4bdd-b559-dc62cbb84fdc"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"University of Denver","tagline":["4 Year","DENVER, CO"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-denver","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7767552476476063},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":42423},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1220-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"In terms of areas for improvement, some students have mentioned that they would like to see more diverse representation within the student body and faculty.

I look forward to the remainder of my time here, excited for the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-07T22:10:33.735276Z","guid":"f785fc96-1d5f-459d-9285-73bee9c71047","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f4a508b24c17e65f299aa0ed9e1d7614aedf93db","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/484b6e39e5df7f2cd1467c13757101bb13c6ea06","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4e50894a8745088c238123773c5c1c111249a16f","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f95ee271ce9ce96bb849bb4fa7cc63386f58ad4f"},"guid":"403958a4-dd7c-4cf5-849e-a40f83c8eb85","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-23T14:44:13.298065Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/14ef0cedb5b12ab393f1d9bd5ebc0ea0005ef7b9"},"guid":"92d9c561-8f40-4953-b025-9a6480cd44df","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:02:39.877219Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.163959,26.185869,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.163959,26.185869,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a1fcc3ec-846b-4b0b-95f0-3f5665fc638b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db4af4d1e2463f63deda69e644367086dfb0809c","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ea6924fbc089c3e9a389a1fc99ca76c38eef138"},"guid":"96c53498-908c-479a-b4f8-95438d2bc93d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-23T14:47:09.805557Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.066666666666666,"count":1215},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/keiser-university-fort-lauderdale/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=keiser-university-fort-lauderdale"}]},{"guid":"42c772ec-29ed-473f-8b5e-195a81fa3b81","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":467,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.6589,"lon":-96.8056},"entity":{"abbreviation":"University of North Texas at Dallas","alternates":{"ipeds":"484905"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"42c772ec-29ed-473f-8b5e-195a81fa3b81","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"DALLAS, TX","name":"University of North Texas at Dallas","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a2ab1556-ac00-46a0-ac94-e9dfedc9331a","gradSchool":"8d2c2442-12b0-4e5a-bed5-78bc6b4d9cca","metroArea":"57178ed6-801f-4b4f-913e-135f42c4afe3","neighborhood":"335677db-e2af-41b3-94a2-07969251ae19","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"2c3a6b7a-f1e6-4001-87dd-63c8b36186c0","zipCode":"50cff28b-286a-4522-abfb-0f1c0ba2cbaf"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"University of North Texas at Dallas","tagline":["4 Year","DALLAS, TX"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-north-texas-at-dallas","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9361358124494745},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10351},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"810-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I’ve truly enjoyed my time at UNT Dallas!

My potential was constantly and appropriately challenged, and I saw definitive growth in my writing, rhetoric, and speaking abilities. The professors are one of the greatest assets of this university, as they are some of the most caring professors I have met in my academic career. As is the case with any religious university, there is some friction over theology and institutional policies. The student handbook definitely has more strict rules for female students as opposed to male students. I also witnessed from several friends' suspensions and expulsions that punishments for female students caught with male students are far harsher than the punishments for the male student. However, they do ask all students to sign the handbook each semester, so if you follow the rules like you say you will, you'll be fine.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-08-16T22:13:06.94354Z","guid":"d319ebc4-3e67-4c60-915e-cce015a4f3fe","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f4ac872f0f84ffbea57d6da1d72ce36ec3b76e09.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ac3195f053893294204741e3212bc43013744e7.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f4ac872f0f84ffbea57d6da1d72ce36ec3b76e09.jpg"},"guid":"e925598f-08cc-4ae4-a0d3-c026f168d936","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ee39032b722a803eeeeac9c7408d21227ac7c504"},"guid":"8007048b-04a6-4cb0-9fe5-8968d39b1493","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:24:51.206647Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.36329,34.87402,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.36329,34.87402,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"af87d923-0901-4ce3-99ab-6c1676987c41","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9168877099911583,"count":1131},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bob-jones-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=bob-jones-university"}]},{"guid":"d2bf807d-b705-42dc-a594-5c82636abe7a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":474,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.0891542,"lon":-80.2281666},"entity":{"abbreviation":"WSSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5909","ipeds":"199999"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d2bf807d-b705-42dc-a594-5c82636abe7a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WINSTON-SALEM, NC","name":"Winston-Salem State University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ba52fd68-37e6-44af-b6b6-54e17fe1eaec","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"829126fb-c467-45a7-addb-397541ef14cf","gradSchool":"2cf20c97-2503-4713-830e-7d05a04dcd0e","metroArea":"0f89224c-4b89-4948-b0c6-d86de9dce3f5","parent":"ba52fd68-37e6-44af-b6b6-54e17fe1eaec","state":"6c719699-2dd3-4c44-9fc0-2d38b35cc1c8","town":"ce874b55-fe1a-4b92-a99b-6baa1daebd9c","zipCode":"33851605-945b-42d5-af92-85c8312631fa"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Winston-Salem State","tagline":["4 Year","WINSTON-SALEM, NC"],"type":"College","url":"winston-salem-state-university","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7338403041825095},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14097},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"830-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Winston-Salem State University is a place where ambition meets opportunity.

I feel a lot of these reviews do not give an accurate depiction of what the school is today, considering they are pretty old. The food has gotten WAY better, i love my professors besides a few class changes, and overall I have felt supported throughout my time here so far. I would say the campus life over the weekends is pretty quiet and everyone leaves to go out or go home. I live in the dorms, specifically laguna hall. I would say the dorms are amazing, we have not had any issues and it is so cool to have a bathroom for just you and your roommates. Of course this is an Assemblies of God Private University, so there is tons of chapel opportunities which I love. I would say if you need a job specifically on campus, try to stay on top of it early. The good jobs go quickly and most of the time go to the upperclassman.  I hope this review helped you and if you do choose Vanguard I am so excited for you and your journey!

First, the campus is welcoming and has a strong sense of community. The faculty and staff are supportive, and they genuinely care about students' success, both academically and personally. The small class sizes allow for more personalized attention from professors, making it easier to engage with the material and ask questions when needed.\n\nThe college also offers a great variety of programs and activities that appeal to my interests. Whether it’s a sport, a club, or a spiritual group, there’s always something to get involved with. This helps me connect with others who share similar passions and makes the college experience more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Northwestern Christian College is a place where I feel supported, challenged, and encouraged to grow both academically and spiritually, making it a great fit for me.

The campus has a welcoming atmosphere, and I've met friendly people during orientation. The smaller size of the university makes it easier to navigate and build meaningful relationships with professors and classmates.\n\nI have received great support from staff and upperclassmen during orientation. They helped answer my questions and made me feel comfortable. I like that the university focuses on hands-on learning and community engagement, which encourages applying what I learn in real-world settings.\n\nHowever, I face challenges adjusting to college life and balancing my time. I worry about making new friends but hope to join clubs and attend events to connect with others. I'm eager to explore my major and the campus outdoor spaces for relaxation. Overall, I believe UW-Parkside is the right place for my academic and personal growth.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-31T03:17:55.728728Z","guid":"e93d3019-ee1a-4eaf-8fee-45ca9fd39693","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/925fdfac5426432f665d52d5ae581ccd99621ff7","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/00aed8f5b862b80b50db557c3f919af9fc9f43b9","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/14fe70e2a6b5200c42f60d9be82d2de347e5de3d","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68ae9e765da04d491cb1fcaa16a89f61f393d08a"},"guid":"dafbd575-0a3c-4f23-9b64-2980e6a28940","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-23T21:31:01.370983Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/61327f607d0bd12727da155e49e9ce12bc46d2e0"},"guid":"0d932db1-3601-4e9d-abaa-6debe3d3b902","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-23T21:58:50.605266Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.855407,42.646074,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.855407,42.646074,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5e651fa8-291e-4fca-9be9-14002423f10a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.625,"count":568},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.uwp.edu/apply/virtualtour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin-parkside/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-wisconsin-parkside"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.uwp.edu/apply/virtualtour/"}]},{"guid":"e13d9100-b21b-49e2-8d37-58c9c4b2a3f9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":486,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.5953,"lon":-84.333},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Clayton State","alternates":{"ceeb":"5145","ipeds":"139311"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e13d9100-b21b-49e2-8d37-58c9c4b2a3f9","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"MORROW, GA","name":"Clayton State University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ddc1254f-642f-480d-9b33-73fa51fe07f7","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"bcccd58a-698e-4501-894e-496690272b86","gradSchool":"74681706-4e01-49be-a46a-0e3c90c3c3e2","metroArea":"41acae5c-e56f-4067-acbe-1e0e26b116b7","onlineChild":"29d412ba-9bca-4c7c-a212-c0631de1d8f4","parent":"ddc1254f-642f-480d-9b33-73fa51fe07f7","state":"2db170c0-259a-4537-ae3e-920d51841b7e","town":"a93ce706-e9e5-4eb5-894f-d7d2195f1fba","zipCode":"71fe81f7-8344-4126-9719-70dd212fb06c"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Clayton State","tagline":["4 Year","MORROW, GA"],"type":"College","url":"clayton-state-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5674585387718512},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":9792},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"890-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Clayton State is a great school to go to. I used to think that it was a very boring school and that there wasn’t anything going on there, but when I started attending the school, it was actually enjoyable. I made a few friends that click with me and it’s always something exciting happening in the building where I take my classes. Spivey Hall is a beautiful music place and it’s almost like you’ve entered a different world there. The Greek life at the school was something that surprised me. I didn’t expect them to be so into it. Homecoming is coming up and many people seem to be excited about it. Although Clayton State doesn’t have an official football team, it’s still fun to enjoy the activities set up by the students.

It truly is the most beautiful campus and I just feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be a student at Western Carolina University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-10T01:29:18.797717Z","guid":"a28850e4-7ff0-4043-943f-bec249555e6d","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/790bb338b21562faf3a629548ab3d7688e160330","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bb971f500b8299c8c1d91f966debc3f997e62283","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0fa73d9c3213a198c96e2bb5fe60f3c2eb9bf1cc","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f065fe1a1ebd897783d176094bf5694424d60b1"},"guid":"0d42a800-e800-4f4a-a9d7-97758eb0da22","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-04T20:50:45.625294Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6c045f2511d0fe3b5da65af9414cfc9d9f8b0074"},"guid":"b51d4217-7ff7-44f2-aa74-34858494ab94","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-12T15:56:30.560812Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.18569699999999,35.309138,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.18569699999999,35.309138,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"4a6adb15-9122-48d0-b16c-bb35ddb5199e","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d6567a3ea7bdd5bb4fefea14a696de42e64d7626","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac7069d692f9ed9eaaad149cd5ffcf67473c596c"},"guid":"6621d0ec-e903-41d6-8c20-329094d8e421","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-27T15:52:01.499856Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8405710886377156,"count":1681},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/139247?pl=v&from=embed-js-failed"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-carolina-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=western-carolina-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/139247?pl=v&from=embed-js-failed"}]},{"guid":"d8cb3f59-b5da-4ea3-8bf2-82e2e592bcd9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":490,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.527957,"lon":-92.073855},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Louisiana - Monroe","alternates":{"ceeb":"6482","ipeds":"159993"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d8cb3f59-b5da-4ea3-8bf2-82e2e592bcd9","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"MONROE, LA","name":"University of Louisiana - Monroe","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"1a31e444-3a24-4771-a4f8-a9cb57380dd9","gradSchool":"db7c749f-695a-4430-abf9-ed9892a5ce0c","state":"0a52f9a9-fad5-4324-8731-e46e1f299b3a","town":"7c8ea8cd-8afa-412d-8ca9-f2f6def19f67","zipCode":"aea116cc-6d1c-4965-ab4a-14aefad978d8"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Louisiana - Monroe","tagline":["4 Year","MONROE, LA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-louisiana-monroe","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7011387404136649},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":11353},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1070-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Starting college at the University of Louisiana at Monroe has been a transformative experience for me. As a first-time college student, I was both excited and nervous about the journey ahead. Choosing Pre-Nursing as my major has been a rewarding decision, as it aligns with my passion for helping others and my interest in healthcare.\n\nThe transition from high school to college has not been without challenges, but it has taught me the importance of perseverance and adaptability. Balancing coursework with new responsibilities has pushed me to grow both academically and personally. I have learned to manage my time effectively, prioritize tasks, and seek help when needed, which has contributed to my current GPA of 3.72.\n\nBeing part of a diverse student body has broadened my perspective and allowed me to appreciate different cultures and viewpoints. This experience has strengthened my resolve to pursue a career in nursing, where I can make a positive impact on people's lives.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-17T06:39:21.973928Z","guid":"05977253-1465-48ec-ada7-d49e48ae1f5f","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"364085fd-f84e-4a94-b9c4-7b7396ecdd8f","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6658195679796695,"count":787},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-louisiana-monroe/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-louisiana-monroe"}]},{"guid":"4e0016c2-91c3-4270-b44e-16b6e6d0784c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":491,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.907371,"lon":-76.993675},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Gallaudet","alternates":{"ceeb":"5240","ipeds":"131450"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"4e0016c2-91c3-4270-b44e-16b6e6d0784c","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"WASHINGTON, DC","name":"Gallaudet University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d73df838-83ae-47ca-82f0-0f68c06ac7c7","gradSchool":"a07d4a52-a867-443d-b816-e315788e66bb","metroArea":"1cd9901c-6cda-4d97-a26e-e3b24e3f25cb","neighborhood":"741e6ed7-eb80-4fdc-9e16-2a91ca138138","state":"d8812b16-d311-48fc-882d-56a7a6f186d4","town":"f88fc330-6f67-485b-b3a0-e2b37c14ca23","zipCode":"5a8a4474-f958-49d7-9102-5ed35817ccc7"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Gallaudet","tagline":["4 Year","WASHINGTON, DC"],"type":"College","url":"gallaudet-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5891891891891892},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13787},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"750-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Gallaudet University is a community where Deaf and hard of hearing students can be together.

I believe that the school has been informed of this for this upcoming semester, so I am not concerned going forward.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-07-17T22:09:07.880281Z","guid":"6a3de274-e622-48f9-a4da-b500c4bca39c","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0cbf22336ecd2ecfd89d59cb4b53f03ccdb8788","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2212bf987b705dd3d8fbdd72b70ffa273f7eb6d2","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0b40d5c205d9c817b45590cc263fee3eaa6174e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb78e6af51406f73cd7747c0630ca6f70257063b"},"guid":"e290a25a-0677-47bf-9439-b52ed2eb1cb6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-05T18:42:14.906972Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/16f829824f8aa3f23ed5ea3378ba602382fb35a2"},"guid":"71c75580-5597-414b-b66a-adee09ad27a2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:12:27.971952Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.750336,35.937152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.750336,35.937152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"1d21adce-64fb-41d8-9292-c68aa811e2cb","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/83546cadc7f55fde7aaa28b68b4afc2d5a457459","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ed517da4e4e1e994d9788fb4174fd91912fc9f26"},"guid":"555f604b-6bbd-4b08-9ef8-cef8c7de61a0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-24T19:27:37.189052Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.00314465408805,"count":318},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youtu.be/75PKmMWnt6g"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/johnson-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=johnson-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youtu.be/75PKmMWnt6g"}]},{"guid":"1b997bd9-8451-44fa-bf60-1b5d24cde35e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":494,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.889756,"lon":-73.901893},"entity":{"abbreviation":"MC","alternates":{"ceeb":"2395","ipeds":"192703"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"1b997bd9-8451-44fa-bf60-1b5d24cde35e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"RIVERDALE, NY","name":"Manhattan University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ae856c91-1330-4738-bcbe-16ee6f5c93ed","gradSchool":"ad3a065d-3d83-4c71-922f-f3c56d01fc65","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"d6cf9fa0-0148-4fcb-a7be-6b97f7286fce","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"59bf7f26-210b-419a-896c-0126c96acbdf","zipCode":"3fea03b3-7e7b-4333-8e11-c9e7c7d9e71f"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Manhattan","tagline":["4 Year","RIVERDALE, NY"],"type":"College","url":"manhattan-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8229607250755288},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":29535},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"As a junior, international, and commuter student at Manhattan University, I can say that the experience has been a mix of positives and challenges. The university’s location in New York City provides unique academic and professional opportunities. The faculty is dedicated, and the academic rigor is high, though the workload can be demanding. As a commuter, the long travel times can make balancing classes and extracurricular activities difficult. The International Student Office has been helpful. The campus is diverse, and there are plenty of clubs and events, but as a commuter, it’s harder to feel fully integrated into campus life. Despite the challenges, the quality of education and access to opportunities in NYC make Manhattan University a great place to study, especially for those seeking a global city experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-24T00:04:10.604353Z","guid":"5cab04fd-8ccf-4333-9234-e15037d940fa","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aaf974ee38129016be9e6c1991175f254aae39f9","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/088dae163048d04d1a23795efe73524d0ffe3452","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b6e8ff9aa146be3fc15f22e6719b486377c5959","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/53a0125c11c1c8bd5806e14da1149de0f93175cf"},"guid":"8398e728-6d66-43ba-bad5-482cd1600e75","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-14T20:00:56.633196Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c45e771432a0c3621d598b656cd11988bf74cf8a"},"guid":"c3d77de8-9617-46d5-9448-e57667b3df8f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-14T18:08:57.193036Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.901893,40.889756,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.901893,40.889756,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"7851188b-4afe-4983-ae1a-57fda779699a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2af219d6b4e0500696cf9c4becaeaf5fc9759a99","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4de8d592bca27d11a65291d982f3aa75dd28a3a3"},"guid":"6716f7ec-7804-4872-985c-5a2a1ec85ddd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-11-29T18:22:03.205372Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5743016759776536,"count":895},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/62170?fromSearch=1&&wph=1&skipPrompt=1&fromSearch=1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/manhattan-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=manhattan-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/62170?fromSearch=1&&wph=1&skipPrompt=1&fromSearch=1"}]},{"guid":"539a5849-0d39-451a-9c94-8891b0cb8bc5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":495,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.3970475,"lon":-97.3261376},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SWAU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6671","ipeds":"228468"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"539a5849-0d39-451a-9c94-8891b0cb8bc5","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"KEENE, TX","name":"Southwestern Adventist University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c1f93ed2-c670-4d85-8e03-8d8d1bc0f6ac","gradSchool":"6969787c-93fd-4a80-ad45-d24f2f7eda9c","metroArea":"57178ed6-801f-4b4f-913e-135f42c4afe3","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"399b8e3d-9ca6-4846-b73b-c7afdc070492","zipCode":"f802de99-5a74-425a-a00e-346aae231691"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Southwestern Adventist","tagline":["4 Year","KEENE, TX"],"type":"College","url":"southwestern-adventist-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5361613351877608},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20028},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"900-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What I enjoy about Southwestern Adventist University is the opportunity the school gives you to better your relationship with God in all aspects of life.

The class sizes in some programs are smaller, allowing for more focused learning. However, professor consistency could improve, as teaching styles vary, making some courses harder to adjust to than others. More standardized teaching methods would help create a more balanced learning experience.\n\nDining options also have room for improvement, as the variety and quality of food could be better. Housing is convenient but can be expensive for what’s offered, and maintenance response times can be slow. Despite these drawbacks, SHSU provides a solid education with a supportive atmosphere. With improvements in professor consistency, food quality, and housing conditions, it could be an even better experience for students, especially those who prefer a quieter and more independent college life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-19T00:38:16.807669Z","guid":"468f69dd-21e3-4e99-a99d-bd49cd5f34c1","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd9af753a7d7ba096b56501c034c83484dcb539d","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a3ed7d1aa36ef86d12944a17d81150a30b59388e","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9eccb082592ff10f06f2d702008d037c6460f067","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eec262860c781505f51ff17796d43fbbc7796b32"},"guid":"9a57a3c2-e4ce-430c-a422-c669a6a41824","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-20T16:27:23.887562Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c24a90ec9ae60460862ff2ad3fc5b5909386236"},"guid":"e5124db4-1569-4533-80b8-6536ffa1f8d1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-13T21:29:00.68067Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.5503803,30.7132435,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.5503803,30.7132435,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f6fe1a9e-2fa9-424b-a08f-4f7b5a815bbf","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f641780124bd49482de8ca5752d850d48dbb466","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/88bac1885ccdc1b1d60435aa8004e654c9b16e91"},"guid":"8cb25570-2951-4686-9f8c-882a2d725283","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-04-22T15:44:36.171688Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.80238924838228,"count":4018},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.shsu.edu/visit"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sam-houston-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=sam-houston-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.shsu.edu/visit"}]},{"guid":"4e4eb415-3f91-4941-b85e-c42fef6f3c2a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":498,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.7571919,"lon":-73.9808315},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Touro","alternates":{"ceeb":"2902","ipeds":"196592"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"4e4eb415-3f91-4941-b85e-c42fef6f3c2a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEW YORK, NY","name":"Touro University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"510ffa3e-a740-4fc0-9626-13343de3d1f0","gradSchool":"2d86df89-8367-4935-a964-80a071a73963","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"1cec43e3-dcb9-433c-8fc7-39ef2bf51f8c","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"be4375aa-a7b8-433d-9864-a8f40bc9dcc1","zipCode":"165b03ac-e0e4-4b3e-a557-8440388eda39"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Touro","tagline":["4 Year","NEW YORK, NY"],"type":"College","url":"touro-university","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7130663164806303},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":23960},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Touro University is renowned for its commitment to academic excellence, providing a supportive environment for students across various disciplines.

Our professors and other faculty actually care about our success and they want to know what's going on in our environments. They are more hands-on than other schools in Central Arkansas.

You have to embrace the uniqueness of the school, because it is so different than most state schools. The party scene is very good, but you do have to be in Greek life. Luckily, it is not very intense and pretty easy to get a bid in a sorority. I do not know much about frats. The one thing to note is that the campus itself is pretty much in the middle of nowhere. Once you are able to have a car on campus it becomes much easier and more fun to go to the beach or anywhere in Narragansett. Another downside is probably the amount of in state students. Probably half of people are from Rhode Island, and a lot of people already know each other which makes it harder but most people I know who were from out of state made friends easily. The programs are really good and there is lots of opportunity to network for careers and find internships through the school. The dining halls are also actually really good! I love it here but it takes some getting used to.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-08T01:03:33.280405Z","guid":"2e5df070-36e1-42ed-96a4-c367fb9f4e97","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.527356,41.484691,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.527356,41.484691,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"6013e7df-91e4-471e-9521-e4d691ab7f9b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.547204738985561,"count":2701},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-rhode-island/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-rhode-island"}]},{"guid":"7f16885e-49fd-4ded-8203-f30f5db7b2f7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":505,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.591137,"lon":-84.775275},"entity":{"abbreviation":"CMU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1106","ipeds":"169248"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7f16885e-49fd-4ded-8203-f30f5db7b2f7","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MOUNT PLEASANT, MI","name":"Central Michigan University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6492aecd-1c98-4b35-b4ee-c097b233fed4","gradSchool":"ffd490b2-8476-42e2-a700-1afcd4b23423","onlineChild":"cbfe6b63-8368-4f81-badf-b8557371df28","state":"0eb3399d-938d-4c33-807a-6fd72141e1d0","town":"14577876-f5b0-436d-8440-bb8d24d88100","zipCode":"7a3ba3c3-b64d-4f51-a913-8b33a97af169"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Central Michigan","tagline":["4 Year","MOUNT PLEASANT, MI"],"type":"College","url":"central-michigan-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7895292697646349},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":15605},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"980-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I genuinely loved my experience Central as a 2020 high school graduate.

I would recommend evangel university to anyone who wants to find a place that truly feels like home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-31T14:16:38.852547Z","guid":"cb8cbac3-1742-4c66-a026-86f7d92de40b","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/498a62c9a88bfb11321c1381eccb107c4bee0409","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4a7c17981afc0f15deec3e514b7f33d77f4db740","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/498a62c9a88bfb11321c1381eccb107c4bee0409","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac9ca817c1f0336b94c77205ee676dcf3f768dcd"},"guid":"4aedca12-48f3-4dde-aae8-88504e765e94","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/349746404d5e7b74ba0912d1c96dec9c4b556f8d"},"guid":"c7703784-a61f-421e-b269-deaa9af44cf0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:06:27.295787Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.262614,37.220956,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.262614,37.220956,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c27454f8-ac48-46f9-9126-3265f0e58009","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/318715b45e7ec8b5e5f297ab10c0440f6b551fbe","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/318715b45e7ec8b5e5f297ab10c0440f6b551fbe"},"guid":"99de09eb-1142-4a8b-b8b1-62a0b36fd316","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.920997920997921,"count":962},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.evangel.edu/toureu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/evangel-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=evangel-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.evangel.edu/toureu/"}]},{"guid":"e5da6025-115b-44b1-aa7a-01ed4f30fad5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":511,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.7284,"lon":-82.7648},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SWU","alternates":{"ceeb":"5896","ipeds":"217776"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e5da6025-115b-44b1-aa7a-01ed4f30fad5","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CENTRAL, SC","name":"Southern Wesleyan University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2ab951c6-886a-4beb-9cca-843730b65629","gradSchool":"53f1ceb1-7eae-4a33-a27b-d653ce354e58","metroArea":"e3ad1b0a-bb02-4b78-8bb8-9e4ea6ea7770","state":"4e14b3cc-29b7-46c8-b531-601bf3625739","town":"ea49a628-8871-43b5-aa0b-29a90dd1dd90","zipCode":"aa0d33ce-7284-4aaa-87db-1c9793e8548f"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Southern Wesleyan","tagline":["4 Year","CENTRAL, SC"],"type":"College","url":"southern-wesleyan-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5187878787878788},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17639},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"990-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended SWU and received a double major in Early Childhood and Elementary Education.

Excellent networking and internship opportunities are made possible by the university's relationships with airlines and business experts, which has been really helpful to me.\n\nThe experiential learning aspect is among my favorite things. The curriculum, which includes technical classes and flying simulators, is meant to give students both academic understanding and practical abilities. Additionally, the campus's diversity enhances the experience by creating a vibrant and inclusive learning environment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-11T21:06:33.880171Z","guid":"de484edd-c8d6-4afc-b150-36c68b98fa7e","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2bb70c059dba798162d3b54b38f9db8bf15b0c7f","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9411d097ab8a81b4fab3dd8ee5728a363b8032cc","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8340703d505aeae67008d62fa3372762c76dc0e9","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2585bc5b4ee7eadd039485feb13724b054982d10"},"guid":"2357fc26-4462-4da0-9231-8fa8a2130ab8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-22T20:47:25.540491Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"79fa2584-ff68-4164-a7af-cd69226d8c76","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6473859844271415,"count":4495},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/sjsu"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/san-jose-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=san-jose-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/sjsu"}]},{"guid":"127c595c-1189-4f6a-bab1-4e1fb7248c61","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":515,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":37.716484,"lon":-97.296733},"entity":{"abbreviation":"WSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6884","ipeds":"156125"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"127c595c-1189-4f6a-bab1-4e1fb7248c61","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WICHITA, KS","name":"Wichita State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2ee536e0-4ea7-4ec4-a4ed-2b704ae6323b","gradSchool":"a4994655-770f-42a4-849e-9f7ddd97460a","metroArea":"7a5a30af-8d17-4054-84a9-6e365732b5e6","onlineChild":"ba9ac182-18ba-497a-a23f-5c7c58c69e86","state":"7c52d070-0372-43da-bc7f-d182b439866a","town":"01d9e450-a926-4a9b-babd-55d8afcd21fe"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Wichita State","tagline":["4 Year","WICHITA, KS"],"type":"College","url":"wichita-state-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9485335430947297},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13553},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"980-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Overall I have had a positive experience attending Wichita State University.

This school is best for commuters, as there is not a whole lot to do on campus, especially on weekends. Most residents go home then. The food in the dining hall is okay, but I like the varying food options they have. It's easy to get around campus as it's on the smaller side. I've really only had issues here with parking since there's a lot of students but not enough parking spaces. There is an overflow lot, but even that sometimes was nearly full and it's in the opposite direction of where my classes were. Otherwise, as a commuting social work student, I enjoyed my time here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-09T17:23:31.779161Z","guid":"3c6787e3-79ea-4b05-95f6-37b84fe18e73","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7ebe47037123b60e0eb3ea5b3808bf624c82b042","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b01a246c918c6d29e967d88e84ee68408806cc67","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f12030ca2df8c9246871056116b71c96902f6fcf","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3db5e8fa56695ecfb66ff761c29317dbd68281eb"},"guid":"6e9791b4-234e-4a77-9ad7-6d232b97c8e1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-17T17:42:58.012715Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/af366c65ca6e67750198890d62a74159e1e650d2"},"guid":"f62ae64a-09c6-4b71-83ee-65d1c4e80724","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-04T13:14:30.601955Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"834c4338-12df-4343-a47c-34eb7b60d1f9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d5ad3ccc0192c0fd9f879d7928d3493d87219abc","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ea3805a2b550d8bda668339cc5acd7f4e7b87a6a"},"guid":"a10905dd-57cc-4854-ab2d-67e2779ab3e3","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-03T17:16:48.883041Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5768261964735517,"count":397},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.usj.edu/usjvirtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-saint-joseph/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-saint-joseph"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.usj.edu/usjvirtualtour"}]},{"guid":"d62788df-48cc-4f06-90b7-d50f9d26a735","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":518,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.946256,"lon":-74.199465},"entity":{"abbreviation":"William Paterson New Jersey","alternates":{"ceeb":"2518","ipeds":"187444"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d62788df-48cc-4f06-90b7-d50f9d26a735","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WAYNE, NJ","name":"William Paterson University of New Jersey","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ce588635-ec8f-4f46-a7c7-8ff1badc26fb","gradSchool":"c3ecfd81-9ba9-4136-9d1a-f3209da70a71","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","state":"ed4102c4-b16f-4ccd-8d8b-ccfeb8fa21ea","town":"127bd9c8-ebee-440e-bea0-d86341c4d6b3","zipCode":"07011cee-ff71-4715-aca9-7e2e73d23c3d"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"William Paterson","tagline":["4 Year","WAYNE, NJ"],"type":"College","url":"william-paterson-university-of-new-jersey","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.915364953138313},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12967},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I started out loving William Paterson and recommending it to everyone. The value of what you get at this school for what you spend is INCREDIBLE!! This school has a lot of unique things to it like the way the Honors College works, the made to order stations at the dining hall, and the campus activities. What has disheartened me the most over the years has been the increase in required online courses. For online students, this is great. For students paying to have an in person college experience and being forced to take online courses, not great. Every semester, at LEAST two of my required classes have only been offered online. There are also not a lot of classes offered anymore, and some even required to graduate which puts you in an impossible spot. When class is in person, most students are on their phones. The general consensus I’ve gotten from my peers is that advisors at this school are not helpful. Despite this, most of the dorms I’ve been in have been awesome, staff is friendly.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-12T23:37:03.684705Z","guid":"18669783-b3f8-4add-a02b-0031a347b176","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe0b56551985edd8269decc94866e9ed38850401","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ee1d6d2d3999a73c27af7285074348aa7fb8b9d0","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe0b56551985edd8269decc94866e9ed38850401","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c645a4ad6456e769fb17740b2ed87b37655180c"},"guid":"1375d13a-3ba7-434d-9bf5-91d92ad5ea24","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/05fb6d7933854898a29ebf498633d86aa1fca390"},"guid":"14e4bb37-4d92-42bb-a0e1-39a7537fb65a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:15:50.127091Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199465,40.946256,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199465,40.946256,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a8b48121-01f1-4756-8e1d-143deeeab8bd","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/706e8a716f1a0bac1034aa6ec2de20a91b7ae43d","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/706e8a716f1a0bac1034aa6ec2de20a91b7ae43d"},"guid":"c78be2b0-e657-415a-a6e3-948406e891c0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5214356929212363,"count":1003},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.wpunj.edu/virtualtour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-paterson-university-of-new-jersey/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=william-paterson-university-of-new-jersey"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.wpunj.edu/virtualtour/"}]},{"guid":"9066192d-2875-4e79-9fd9-1b25e3bc1601","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":519,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.060814,"lon":-80.051814},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SRU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2658","ipeds":"216038"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"9066192d-2875-4e79-9fd9-1b25e3bc1601","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"SLIPPERY ROCK, PA","name":"Slippery Rock University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ca6825bc-6bae-42f5-a177-dd4dc11329d0","gradSchool":"c5193ee6-3d98-4194-b25c-e9c831cc3406","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"4bc06edc-af8a-4f79-bb07-ac0975b97b04","zipCode":"4f181f32-17c2-4d72-9b85-e0af782ba3a2"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Slippery Rock","tagline":["4 Year","SLIPPERY ROCK, PA"],"type":"College","url":"slippery-rock-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.743337506707208},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17873},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Within the public health program professors actually cared!

The school does a good job of setting up activities, especially in the beginning of the year, for the students like Redfest a celebration of D'Youville complete with bands and amusement park rides.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-22T02:09:37.491476Z","guid":"beec483a-181f-4868-9e16-6e2998add3f4","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/473530d8507e738073b51f3305f96c30cfc1eb42","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/06433f44d8a0fb95c81953f2df516df944561600","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1af13006d3af75cfa4a2912991b09f292188512e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d90be59f9303d2b4c3058f29824964736f7ac2b1"},"guid":"1c9f13ad-3917-450f-8e7e-6805480715fd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-11-15T17:22:59.453509Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a1a4a85b4759789dd4225d14eeb78a90947e016"},"guid":"9ccdf022-6643-4c83-8257-29debb6aeb48","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:17:45.581021Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"dded0a4f-e0ec-4d9e-b532-164c5d571f6d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7922f919339e30f8689f441511e719a366927fab","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4dcbc85ab50dd9a6be94dda1457d6145be82fb7d"},"guid":"f88fcb78-164b-4dd7-9810-b5044fe71e3b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-11-15T17:36:10.373442Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5526315789473686,"count":456},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.dyu.edu/admissions/visit/campus-map-and-tour.aspx"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dyouville-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=dyouville-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.dyu.edu/admissions/visit/campus-map-and-tour.aspx"}]},{"guid":"21f8641e-453a-43ad-9945-eec60c6d7031","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":525,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.417168,"lon":-83.138369},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Detroit Mercy","alternates":{"ceeb":"1835","ipeds":"169716"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"21f8641e-453a-43ad-9945-eec60c6d7031","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"DETROIT, MI","name":"University of Detroit Mercy","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e9a96ccc-eee1-4356-8894-d82fdfa5b98b","gradSchool":"b46ca4ad-a624-457a-8590-e9d838cfd278","metroArea":"6622ac53-6938-4e48-b907-8fe7b1e6733f","neighborhood":"ab205786-ada0-4f83-911e-665cbab0e2df","state":"0eb3399d-938d-4c33-807a-6fd72141e1d0","town":"2f720a83-625b-4332-8568-0fcf61040b73","zipCode":"d473bb0e-a617-4613-833d-07e0867d614b"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Detroit Mercy","tagline":["4 Year","DETROIT, MI"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-detroit-mercy","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9051774287376382},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":18197},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What I like most about Detroit mercy is the diversity we have.

Seeing how far you grow and come makes you feel successful and happy. I’m not sure what I’d like to see change. Maybe something could be the events hosted on campus. Making more people aware of them.

It shaped the basis of my personality, someone who values interdisciplinary work, who sees the value in different perspectives, and who seeks belonging. The university is small, which means your professor will know your name and your work, which is both a blessing and a curse. You will recognize the workers in the cafeterias, in the library, in the cleaning crews. The student life includes both Greek organizaitions, an abundance of clubs to join, and plenty of open spaces to merely relax with friends. The pizza place, the Cellar, is great for a special occasion, and movies at the small theater a great way to spend a weekend evening. Closeby are the waterfront, Proctor shopping district, and tons of restaurants along 6th ave. The school is expensive, the main drawback.

I've had days that the stress affected me more, and one or all of my professors usually notice and make it a point to see if I'm doing okay. Additionally, MidAmerica Nazarene University is passionate about academics, and push their students to a higher-level of learning. Classes can be difficult, but I feel like I'm more prepared than I would have been at a different school. I would like to see MNU work on their communication, and providing for commuters better.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-09-16T19:47:30.346234Z","guid":"d28c7927-50a2-4a38-9b3d-edcded08e3a9","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2f197cefe5a0bddc9bc6e215b7b67cc51afc41ca","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8207139ee33f07afb44d7c92a9c126353bf2f87c","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2f197cefe5a0bddc9bc6e215b7b67cc51afc41ca","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c31d0468c177b875a307f5f4352237e2564782c2"},"guid":"31d0bd98-b517-4517-a0d4-414cf689c266","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a42947a094ddefe3f606f31b032b4bad0756d3bd"},"guid":"93e9b74b-46be-4279-97c6-37a415cc3c15","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:02:22.466855Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.782586,38.872608,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.782586,38.872608,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"fae1fce2-f2f1-4fa6-b960-5d8670b49383","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8766233766233764,"count":308},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://visitour.io/midamerica-nazarene-university/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/midamerica-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=midamerica-nazarene-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://visitour.io/midamerica-nazarene-university/"}]},{"guid":"86825bfe-4bfd-45f6-992b-af03615faa7b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":530,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.793949,"lon":-89.997779},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SIUE","alternates":{"ceeb":"1759","ipeds":"149231"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"86825bfe-4bfd-45f6-992b-af03615faa7b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"EDWARDSVILLE, IL","name":"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"4a7f97eb-251c-4924-ae75-83e3117f8500","gradSchool":"5fe1ef9f-c8f7-4187-a3a9-f314afc33df0","metroArea":"2627dfb0-1f42-430d-8400-50da46ac0496","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"23a18cfa-c1d3-478f-87fc-7e4e6fd2555f","zipCode":"404de1f4-aa31-4e90-a639-d7de5a3fde26"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Southern Illinois Edwardsville","tagline":["4 Year","EDWARDSVILLE, IL"],"type":"College","url":"southern-illinois-university-edwardsville","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9751206434316354},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13586},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"My journey through the Master's program in Diversity and Equity in Education in the United States has been a pivotal and inspiring phase of my academic and personal growth.

Overall, the college has good academics and many activities that the school puts on.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-02T20:44:40.864839Z","guid":"d61a88eb-09e9-4e72-9be8-a3f06d16928e","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/40dd244c12a721709d74318fa6a63680f0ba04cf","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/52e1875ddfff298d473f598caa7a8c4408cfedc4","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45a011132cd7d087f14c7e0eca75f070c6b4cd9d","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/941e770867b67cfcd7286713f3b6ec310946e89f"},"guid":"8a3d117e-c152-4f8d-90ab-24dc87ee433a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-02T17:48:08.151635Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b69822af335e5e93dc432b5f495a2f35f1c26a5e"},"guid":"eac702fa-ec5c-4bbb-a002-3e680bb26a42","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-08T12:58:50.766343Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"a3a27d86-5b0e-45d0-94c6-d8641c80d42a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/778a1be072f1449ec567262372bb09a25c4d7f6a","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26903300f764bb9bf513c89c7b99fed58bccdabb"},"guid":"2c1182d6-c346-425f-9778-267779b60cb5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-02T18:13:55.167078Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.617598684210526,"count":1216},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/oneonta"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-oneonta/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=suny-oneonta"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/oneonta"}]},{"guid":"3602fc0f-fca6-4a42-8e3d-2ae888e5927f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":544,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.2421023,"lon":-95.904614},"entity":{"abbreviation":"East Texas A&M University","alternates":{"ceeb":"6188","ipeds":"224554"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"3602fc0f-fca6-4a42-8e3d-2ae888e5927f","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"COMMERCE, TX","name":"East Texas A&M University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"5d77fe05-4d2c-4a08-8507-3a29885b7739","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a3f03b99-b512-4842-b9c4-f19bea033a02","gradSchool":"74aadd8e-977a-43f8-a8ab-20a0f20630b1","onlineChild":"8b419958-9850-4043-bbf6-fa58f051b207","parent":"5d77fe05-4d2c-4a08-8507-3a29885b7739","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"866dc3fe-4042-4f3a-b55d-178505a579d1","zipCode":"8cac2a6b-0e38-4dd1-adf3-60a6e6f4926e"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"East Texas A&M University","tagline":["4 Year","COMMERCE, TX"],"type":"College","url":"east-texas-a-and-m-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8646069968196275},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13025},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"910-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience with TAMU was amazing!

I joined the Muslim Student Association my sophomore year and was a board member all through my sophomore up until my senior year where I was the president. I was also a part of the student government association Diversity, equity, and inclusion which helped push me out there a lot.

The courses offered were excellent.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-26T17:03:45.621421Z","guid":"b5789ed7-627a-49ec-8774-90af0ae3223f","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9264d534ed2faa81aff58e774bbb58aac9fb6845","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/21de5eac9570030ee1d47abb5e76e9b3a87612c1","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9cb013fc86a0941e01390a02a16ef78392429383","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2efc9f8172aa85bdae329855f3571054769926b"},"guid":"2b9f9a71-ba3a-41af-a613-33c18c1b9b01","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-07-12T19:22:07.540894Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.855553,40.731495,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.855553,40.731495,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"ca650999-18c0-40bc-b911-1ad4d375026a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.732420091324201,"count":1095},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://massinteract.com/westminster-university/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/westminster-university-utah/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=westminster-university-utah"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://massinteract.com/westminster-university/"}]},{"guid":"245d037c-95fa-4a57-8c8c-c061cf791e92","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":551,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":32.427756,"lon":-81.782201},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Georgia Southern","alternates":{"ceeb":"5253","ipeds":"139931"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"245d037c-95fa-4a57-8c8c-c061cf791e92","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"STATESBORO, GA","name":"Georgia Southern University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"664510e7-c19b-47f5-937c-771049ddfa58","gradSchool":"8a335357-4a8e-4a88-8cbf-85fb075e9d2b","onlineChild":"1adae056-8d85-41a3-8282-bbbf3e96ad01","state":"2db170c0-259a-4537-ae3e-920d51841b7e","town":"89f4d894-9f9a-4716-8a39-85f7974f8de6","zipCode":"2b5a9a95-3b41-49a9-8757-16543ac124cd"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Georgia Southern","tagline":["4 Year","STATESBORO, GA"],"type":"College","url":"georgia-southern-university","variation":5},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8890630323679728},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":15352},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"980-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Georgia Southern has always been home for me.

All games are so fun and you can experience what being a true Eagles fan is all about. As far as my education, I have had the best professors. Every one of them are so passionate about their jobs and this really makes me want to be involved in class as well as makes me excited to continue my education into the grad program.

This is very much not a party school. I see it as a pro, as there is more of a community focus on academics. It can be hard to feel like you have a community since a majority of the school are transfer students, or otherwise do not live on campus. The food is great, there is a lot of options, and you are extremely close to everything Portland has to offer. Regardless of PSU being a transfer school, it is not hard to make friends and enjoy your time there. There is so much to do! One thing I would like to see change is the school's communication with students. You have to work hard to find basic information like requirements for your degree, or when a class is being offered.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-07T00:27:39.145876Z","guid":"469ea7e2-182e-4d93-9943-082e3ed0bf1d","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/62b01a52aa1060dda783fc889f287c7404517156","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9421c06555845ed4c2e68f05a4f1d3211991263b","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/90196465dcb3e9fb92c55fc7ad658fbc13beeff0","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fc40300170a9616554732e0e28766f6904906a04"},"guid":"db109a94-f4d7-42cb-b234-70d1dfea84d0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-02T23:12:51.563854Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/16b93f6bedc82ff4ff263711ee0b9bc9f5ff79ff"},"guid":"7adee2d0-70a7-4c7b-bc97-9c050b8e6e6f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-06T22:57:56.378333Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.683553,45.511229,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.683553,45.511229,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f6069e65-5943-415d-8f0e-2d3086305256","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd38771deaa7e28aaf45932d4fcf853278d939cd","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/086909792807e19b45e5d0696af46e48b029c44c"},"guid":"fa9eb18a-76e2-4ce2-9f8c-4c9f5ceeaca2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-05-09T20:02:02.922451Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.654014598540146,"count":2740},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/portlandstate"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/portland-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=portland-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/portlandstate"}]},{"guid":"dd415fea-a0c7-4a27-9bd3-09b49b9d812d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":553,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.188929,"lon":-80.832227},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Queens","alternates":{"ceeb":"5560","ipeds":"199412"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"dd415fea-a0c7-4a27-9bd3-09b49b9d812d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CHARLOTTE, NC","name":"Queens University of Charlotte","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e1c3263c-9087-413c-82db-ad3546077ba2","gradSchool":"e7a19c9e-4755-4260-b9e6-5498c24760fe","metroArea":"a09a63e8-be06-4c5d-9887-752e64a5cb2e","neighborhood":"715f360c-5ffb-47e8-938f-3af5f43d221f","state":"6c719699-2dd3-4c44-9fc0-2d38b35cc1c8","town":"891ca053-fd28-4b8d-ac00-4d268871d56e","zipCode":"8f49101a-ba6d-4e0e-aeee-80b23aacb9a6"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Queens","tagline":["4 Year","CHARLOTTE, NC"],"type":"College","url":"queens-university-of-charlotte","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7127457197209892},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":29459},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1080-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"When i was in seventh grade, i had a dream about a camous where i could do sports, live in dormitories and practice high-performance sports all at once.

It's academical record holds a good reputation amongst other colleges in North Carolina, and its faculty members are as sweet and caring as one can imagine. Campus life is fun as well. Some may think that because of Queen's small campus that there isn't much to do, but trust me, size doesn't matter! i have met students from all over the world, and everyone is easy-going and kind, this is the perfect environment for a Royal. And in the changing of the seasons? i think that's the prettiest part of campus. For example, you get to see all the students having fun outside in the summer.\n\nAll i can say is, i'm very grateful for being a part of the Royals community, and i'm proud to represent my team in national triathlon events as well.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-08-22T01:28:16.266716Z","guid":"344b64cb-87b3-476d-8d38-75925c195f67","helpfulness":4,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b4cc4f6bf6d9a125a626a262f86542e0d33ed884","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/478d864379d9893970bada6d873a21961234280c","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8b31f98673236e5a4821c3746b9ad6b522c6f037","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/06da2d74e0a4dcb8e8d7ae64e897513814a9c076"},"guid":"9ac895b2-8c52-4b52-b5ef-d3c46b6a7ace","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-04-20T15:00:32.344785Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/816b280227c92800a3494df0cda5cf5b57156b64"},"guid":"9e928bd1-11ed-4d28-a639-5cf43efd5830","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-04-21T19:19:55.267913Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"52bb16e7-fef8-431f-9a19-319d0d0e5b58","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dad27da3abb447fd4eed312406c3fd1db9823ed5","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d39d29c89c76b97f7f213674745da08269e83348"},"guid":"89ccb55d-e0b3-47d7-b4a4-bf747a8e368b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-22T12:51:53.33492Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7536,"count":625},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.queens.edu/admissions/360-virtual-campus-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/queens-university-of-charlotte/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=queens-university-of-charlotte"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.queens.edu/admissions/360-virtual-campus-tour/"}]},{"guid":"860d91fd-a1b3-435f-948f-aa473e2c0493","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":554,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.2415477,"lon":-85.7588742},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1552","ipeds":"157757"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"860d91fd-a1b3-435f-948f-aa473e2c0493","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"LOUISVILLE, KY","name":"Spalding University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a1973212-487c-4885-a11a-94a3c60a0aaf","gradSchool":"52cdfdf2-b5be-45da-871c-0f42b90f6ec3","metroArea":"e66e365d-e567-4c2d-8712-4842faadf0d9","neighborhood":"94dcbf4b-b245-491d-bdcd-5611b80ea61f","state":"27966205-db74-44e6-8d2d-79a4df61742a","zipCode":"d11e1a66-de29-47f8-9b93-fef15d34624e"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Spalding","tagline":["4 Year","LOUISVILLE, KY"],"type":"College","url":"spalding-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9763888888888889},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":26539},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"880-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have grown to enjoy my time at Spalding over the past three years.

It’s a place where I feel empowered to dream big and achieve my full potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-04T02:20:26.55529Z","guid":"9d3a2765-7d72-41be-809a-97efd02e31f8","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/81f64d48bb51a41f9c9d2e4fc3e9f2f4b6227509","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cec591e47119373c75b80902ea175ae2b96389a8","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9dd17d9c580e4108fbc81566502042b43f58c0ff","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6eb1b65b77ef9320217f7a9ff4656dd8e79f7eca"},"guid":"bbb2ecd3-c54f-4321-a69c-c503c8689e1c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-21T19:50:31.563227Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/931ebf313091f84e986eaefc0d4a6a2597cc22a8"},"guid":"25d79d13-5a30-4bfa-98ff-3010f96fd5ec","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-01-31T13:50:07.055068Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.791323,44.828888,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.791323,44.828888,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"6b4501d4-8247-4cef-8138-424343b4c011","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/62e5b0449629afccca687580dfe91d5937a799c5","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0ba82e93bbe5c8f57cedadd0ec5b89d06fad6412"},"guid":"06d1a7dc-e9bf-4e23-ab2a-245ff4ebf2bd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-21T20:05:30.727794Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6133464180569184,"count":1019},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/husson"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/husson-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=husson-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/husson"}]},{"guid":"96732c0e-61bd-439b-936f-b8566785f060","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":558,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.589879,"lon":-75.161343},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SLU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2805","ipeds":"195216"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"96732c0e-61bd-439b-936f-b8566785f060","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CANTON, NY","name":"St. Lawrence University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"289f0f4b-2ce6-44b5-aeb7-4eddf8456f23","gradSchool":"f8e7ccee-ad9f-47d6-8360-c2fa6228b31b","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"763be8fa-470d-49df-8ae4-3653a173191e","zipCode":"cf974b6f-6f82-4355-ac68-1089970b3358"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"St. Lawrence","tagline":["4 Year","CANTON, NY"],"type":"College","url":"st-lawrence-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6349574632637278},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33283},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1240-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"St. Lawrence gave me a fantastic education that truly changed my life.

I liked it so much that perhaps unlike many of my peers, I'd like to stay in this small town, with educators I can connect with and use as a monumental foundation for my future career life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-09-09T15:50:39.460113Z","guid":"f908fc59-5ec6-41f0-b5cf-bf30fd76c431","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7977a933b7820d0043ff9388d06de48a88825a3f","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0de55abf53b0a07104d6d3cedfb788c89bf83e6d","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c8404c7bb40bd52aceb4edcc1fe1ca9ddab6a6fd","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca8aaa9558d814e6ae3a2e960999aac758a1d0b9"},"guid":"be50f3bd-a315-432f-84a9-c20576b9d4f6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-24T20:23:25.197331Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4135ff66e4499ec667725dd93c52acab5967411c"},"guid":"84a03ac9-e96d-463e-b967-b5a87a703b75","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-02-07T23:52:45.952041Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.109609,44.0127,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.109609,44.0127,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"86f26a85-1ad9-47f9-ac95-5df276411354","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5ef9fbae2fdacd7d02732118d20e2ee90c411af0","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7addeed051d0b37d633f04df6ddb55883e25129"},"guid":"763d7559-58a7-4ec1-bbbb-89809dcc1279","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-24T20:39:12.669212Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6372549019607843,"count":306},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://map.dsu.edu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dakota-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=dakota-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://map.dsu.edu/"}]},{"guid":"f4c38908-f077-4659-a1b5-c6635d25a717","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":562,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":29.763831,"lon":-95.35953},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UHD","alternates":{"ceeb":"6922","ipeds":"225432"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f4c38908-f077-4659-a1b5-c6635d25a717","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"HOUSTON, TX","name":"University of Houston - Downtown","parentGUIDs":{"college":"92fa2604-6c99-4b09-b8f0-61d6996916f6","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"125697c7-5b80-4c39-a192-dd7c6c9422f9","gradSchool":"cf1ec1cd-ae62-48a0-a431-bcdcba2d3325","metroArea":"77c890e1-5b09-4a33-b0fe-9defd7c77f94","neighborhood":"dcb0b3b4-6fbd-4e92-8467-255e2f3ff117","parent":"92fa2604-6c99-4b09-b8f0-61d6996916f6","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"14c096e9-d877-4d24-b414-eb1d24c9f04a","zipCode":"7da38bbe-e583-4bc0-a366-051cb3c3c1b7"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UHD","tagline":["4 Year","HOUSTON, TX"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-houston-downtown","variation":9},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8841950742130158},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14911},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Other","body":"The University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) is a public university located in the heart of downtown Houston, Texas.

After saving enough money to cover the next two semesters, I knew I needed another source of income. Unfortunately, financial aid wasn’t an option for me, so scholarships became my only hope. The professors here are open-minded, and I always take advantage of office hours whenever they’re available. My advisors at the College of Liberal Arts have been incredibly helpful in narrowing down my options and guiding me toward the right path. Some classes that many students see as unnecessary, like the first-year seminar, actually provide valuable insights. That class helped me understand the campus and resources available at UNLV, while the second-year seminar helped me reflect on my long-term goals. Overall, UNLV has given me a great education and so much more.

The amount of programs, clubs, and communities service events are outstanding. The only thing is, is that they should provide events on the weekend as well to people who can not attend them during the week. Stockton is a very safe and supportive school as well.

I appreciate the supportive environment, strong academic programs, and dedicated faculty who genuinely care about student success. The sense of community and tradition is something I value deeply, and the focus on empowering women is inspiring.  \n\nHowever, I believe there’s room for improvement in fostering diversity and inclusion. While the campus feels safe, more efforts could be made to celebrate different cultures and address issues like racism, which can be disheartening. Encouraging open dialogue, providing diversity training, and hosting cultural events could help create a more inclusive community.  \n\nMeredith College is a place of growth and opportunity, and I hope to see it continue evolving into an even more welcoming and diverse environment where everyone feels valued and respected.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-13T02:27:18.585412Z","guid":"d523ca5f-ebdd-4f1b-9852-dbe77251da51","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/90bc7851316935fad8d70dd4a569551fdef63784","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/17ae150adabd724f01965fd3c89cb60365846e08","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/37617a5a5b7700ce1cb168b1d7c49341254291d6","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3988b4eb66273dfb19be99eed88b977ee0cf871b"},"guid":"d5ac6358-98a8-4d3f-a6b5-701bcd9c8506","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-02T20:03:13.487195Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d4aab411b9c222cffbff90df3b49c18a9eec7be"},"guid":"782b3b76-9cf5-4436-9a24-d2aec351020c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-09-30T17:27:32.329013Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.689175,35.797197,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.689175,35.797197,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"01556410-d36d-4687-8a8f-df9277d7c1c3","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9d897824a78567c64c257e898e957d6940924c01","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/11616e3690f6d30be0282979d35fc2bc668dfe4f"},"guid":"922873d1-183d-4f3b-9258-8dd8b4bbd119","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-11-16T19:57:24.772559Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9271781534460337,"count":769},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.meredith.edu/virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/meredith-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=meredith-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.meredith.edu/virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"fb374336-0f1b-4cc8-8b67-7f3c2eea4e00","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":567,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.509724,"lon":-88.99234},"entity":{"abbreviation":"ISU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1319","ipeds":"145813"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"fb374336-0f1b-4cc8-8b67-7f3c2eea4e00","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"NORMAL, IL","name":"Illinois State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"0e71946f-b04d-49ef-b3d6-e38c4e088432","gradSchool":"a496c3b6-494f-4d07-bc9d-0dc8b767b421","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"ca84f2e9-de6e-4b8f-8c37-2c868260fba5","zipCode":"9b38c805-afbc-4a12-b4e5-b6083b3af727"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Illinois State","tagline":["4 Year","NORMAL, IL"],"type":"College","url":"illinois-state-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8623947952703052},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20551},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1000-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"ISU provided an incredible experience that shaped my personal and professional growth.

Coming into WIU I was excited to meet new people and gain new opportunities. I was able to make new friends and join many organizations such a Latín Fraternity, Mutlicultural and leadership groups. Joining these organizations has brought me many opportunities that has helped my journey throughout college. I appreciate how envolved and welcoming student life has been and the connection I’ve made along the way. However, the biggest challenge Ive had to face is paying for tuition. After the semester of Fall 2024, I feared that I wasn’t able to return because of my remaining balance that was restricting my ability to register for Spring 2025 classes but with the help of family members I was able to continue my education. WIU faces with many problems distributing students financial aid and scholarships . I would like to see WIU strengthen their financial ability to support their students afford college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-16T02:07:31.76836Z","guid":"0cdfdd65-33ce-4c03-b07f-352bd05d3aac","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/13aa71d14027bbd81434c7ba963dbc4398e2b6bc","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e2bed0cff2b8df9dbedcd7d70e72cd9541ccfb73","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1473f1ecaaa1c47db5ce2215c6e20e3e1220e2ae","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/369ba2703e8c661a57e381ee423adc04a2d73538"},"guid":"5592f236-0b57-4863-92e7-a050be71c152","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-11T14:29:51.839706Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/02f9ec340be796e866f91f77fab35fd275259345"},"guid":"df49df61-7356-4d12-849c-075b97d524ab","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-11T14:28:15.609089Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.685235,40.465621,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.685235,40.465621,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d78e6d24-8283-4734-99ae-556c92f04744","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9484790eab0710a15927450867f081806811af73","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/47efc0f20e5a19571563cf2c6509ae643cdb52ce"},"guid":"1f4badd9-71c7-48e5-8d95-93ad01e815c4","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-05T16:31:41.263231Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5520088057237205,"count":1817},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.wiu.edu/visit/virtual.php"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-illinois-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=western-illinois-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.wiu.edu/visit/virtual.php"}]},{"guid":"16779aec-9bde-4fe8-8f4a-5eb5502ed639","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":571,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":38.712488,"lon":-85.461086},"entity":{"abbreviation":"HC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1290","ipeds":"150756"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"16779aec-9bde-4fe8-8f4a-5eb5502ed639","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"HANOVER, IN","name":"Hanover College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"565b9833-d966-49e7-92c0-74c9b020a5c9","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"58b2ac09-1704-4754-80ee-93c65ba52e76","zipCode":"12fe0923-c2c5-4da3-bc55-a48695496fd9"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Hanover","tagline":["4 Year","HANOVER, IN"],"type":"College","url":"hanover-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7432986439608956},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":26599},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1090-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Hanover College gives students the opportunity to receive a world class \"Ivy League\" style education, all while being able to compete in athletics at a high level, participate in an amazing Greek life scene, and develop into a well-rounded adult.

I also didn't appreciate the way campus safety handles the parking situation for students, ticketing almost constantly and not enforcing parking rules when need be.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-31T17:44:03.340297Z","guid":"10cf1632-9b73-42e4-82d5-f521209b431e","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/891ee50549c20608e85855ac1664681d4138a295","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e4931f0e861ad59a843af1fe3316b6af00386569","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e348dc73e32d0d334307969415ad31f85869286d","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/61975ce529a8432be3a3fa058e49650ccbaeb20b"},"guid":"26ea976d-8937-4c0d-985e-e800b8fde26f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-11T18:37:24.417601Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/648afbdd43399af1f7cd4a784b3bb30add4ae457"},"guid":"160fecd6-f37d-4b15-b699-ecae3f8669c9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-11T18:54:41.759046Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.461086,38.712488,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.461086,38.712488,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"20dcb117-283d-4e11-abbd-4210e1c5ea83","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48608f32c5b0a4a0a8a6efa2abeb3ab71f941aa6","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a4f7ba0e8c9c4ecb04e2036112d5ffa277bf162"},"guid":"ac95d8c5-e58b-4cbf-b6c8-444872f5392c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-11T14:52:09.254855Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.596039603960396,"count":505},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.hanover.edu/collegetour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hanover-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=hanover-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.hanover.edu/collegetour/"}]},{"guid":"d0f99d70-e991-434a-a22b-d01ba983143d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":572,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":21.290274,"lon":-157.807642},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Chaminade","alternates":{"ceeb":"4105","ipeds":"141486"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d0f99d70-e991-434a-a22b-d01ba983143d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"HONOLULU, HI","name":"Chaminade University of Honolulu","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6c09d9f8-a7ec-4a81-95eb-facbd9b9cc37","gradSchool":"af969d43-fb90-4a31-91b0-4671036b9466","metroArea":"ac4e8ceb-d4f2-4427-b642-da6f57ca97e4","state":"0278a07c-335b-4da6-9271-9c0d5b989617","town":"e7dc756b-dc08-41c3-9cae-5fa2e8989755","zipCode":"e1131455-e376-4f3f-a140-89f4b8029d6c"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Chaminade University","tagline":["4 Year","HONOLULU, HI"],"type":"College","url":"chaminade-university-of-honolulu","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9341057204923968},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":27315},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"In my time as an undergraduate student here at Chaminade University, I have found great opportunities to explore new avenues and career choices while remaining home and connected to my community. The ability to take online courses while remaining a full-time day student has been great, because I am able to pursue other ventures like internships and jobs outside of school while still completing all my necessary credits. One difficulty I have found in my time here is that courses are sometimes cancelled due to low enrollment, and if they are a graduation requirement it becomes a complex process to ensure enrollment so one can take the courses. The campus community is very tight knit, because of the size of the university, so there is a very high chance you will know the other students in your classes. That has been a great benefit, as there are opportunities to study together and help one another out.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-27T19:00:23.468292Z","guid":"ca0f9d14-10f0-4747-b2e3-2b038b921e02","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aea35b8f68d8de4498efbee855276be8c2c32827","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2abb6f41dc6d0c4b6476dc6a8095f5b739ed99ef","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f5b14b7f236326cd657d9ec324d01a75e661602","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/67f3f83df3545e339b2ced23efcea8939001a354"},"guid":"1ebbbdac-c4a8-4852-8710-fabbe0c8c80c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-04-11T17:50:07.705376Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5fcd36459f483f093aa45bfb79cfd21d31ae9961"},"guid":"e7bfeef8-5900-460b-a802-bcea99930cd5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-04-25T18:32:44.897805Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.807642,21.290274,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.807642,21.290274,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"4ae656aa-2348-4218-9a3b-7a8356490c5a","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eede703e88349bee84fab4a941b62f0137f51259","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd4172f505d82bd840e4eb7cc10ab38e8ebc52a9"},"guid":"7ac362b9-f4a8-4967-bb9a-0d29b6b14bbd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-04-25T21:29:43.221099Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.900958466453674,"count":626},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/Ao_j9YMTj/stop/1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/chaminade-university-of-honolulu/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=chaminade-university-of-honolulu"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/Ao_j9YMTj/stop/1"}]},{"guid":"3d7c8356-a800-47f2-bd59-fc3968e1f37d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":573,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.769996,"lon":-84.29563},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Agnes Scott","alternates":{"ceeb":"5002","ipeds":"138600"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"Women's College","guid":"3d7c8356-a800-47f2-bd59-fc3968e1f37d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"DECATUR, GA","name":"Agnes Scott College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"77fdac70-0c3a-4db3-a355-401747b7f0b4","gradSchool":"80b9c420-796f-490b-828b-2a8b79abdc90","metroArea":"41acae5c-e56f-4067-acbe-1e0e26b116b7","state":"2db170c0-259a-4537-ae3e-920d51841b7e","town":"a9c905ff-3116-4b35-85db-8190b90f6723","zipCode":"c12fa4ce-6a53-4ee7-a4b8-38ad6239fc3f"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Agnes Scott","tagline":["4 Year","DECATUR, GA"],"type":"College","url":"agnes-scott-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6657754010695187},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24305},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1130-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Being a student at Agnes School has been an incredible experience.

The campus is smaller and classes are more condensed, meaning I receive individualized attention from my professors. JCU is close to where I live, enabling me to commute every day instead of live on-campus. It has over 100 student organizations, which suits me perfectly because I love being involved in a wide variety of activities. Currently, I'm in four clubs and have three on-campus jobs. JCU also has a leadership development program, allowing me to hold six leadership positions during my time as an undergraduate student. A big deciding factor was JCU having a music program, since I wanted to continue playing my instrument during college. Now, I'm in three musical ensembles. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at John Carroll University, so much to the point where I'm looking to stay there for graduate school and apply for numerous graduate assistant positions. I'm also strongly considering working for JCU until kingdom come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-28T09:33:01.616892Z","guid":"0fbe74ad-25fe-4508-9e1a-2d21cee56e8f","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/21bcaad0ca18799398b954d7cd2783b84b19cc50","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4c701931b8a92c82ec35e3395f48bfcd7498237b","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/47a76668950196c9b98d7a6170570b276bb48de8","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cf801cea220906a7f191cda993165c82c353132"},"guid":"640d21ac-6acd-4568-964f-e75d26f0a8a9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-05T13:41:12.59491Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c7de7c7476901ca88b3f8cc1d1c487335fee65a8"},"guid":"1043c8e9-9b33-4a7d-ae17-61fd2e5b84f0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-30T13:30:21.998623Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.533103,41.488978,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.533103,41.488978,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"094477e8-93a7-4f57-9890-8408dfaf2fb9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48a5c2901e7bb85ea5121fe899cf14df0a38921d","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f069d64afb375d7f7cd7d3c0455622dce12de501"},"guid":"6d732b7e-7005-42ab-9bdb-ec2c3d8128d6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-04-18T16:35:24.139816Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6075085324232083,"count":879},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://jcu.edu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/john-carroll-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=john-carroll-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://jcu.edu/"}]},{"guid":"760efb74-b98a-49df-950f-0cbdc1098b69","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":578,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.437496,"lon":-79.993046},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Duquesne","alternates":{"ceeb":"2196","ipeds":"212106"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"760efb74-b98a-49df-950f-0cbdc1098b69","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"PITTSBURGH, PA","name":"Duquesne University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"eebe21fb-3bc4-44a1-8c96-a465d0442acb","gradSchool":"f39973db-3dbd-4f4a-b133-9e25a04d8b68","metroArea":"15cc22ec-ecaf-411f-ac7a-8665d6adeb3a","neighborhood":"8c6dbf66-2ed6-4fd5-9c57-8bdc45a3ac11","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"56f000ed-ce4a-4636-a0bf-4fe70e652684","zipCode":"eac18ddb-a4bf-40c7-9241-55d90261f850"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Duquesne","tagline":["4 Year","PITTSBURGH, PA"],"type":"College","url":"duquesne-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8773001139879498},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":33919},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1160-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a current student at Duquesne University, I can confidently say that my time here has been nothing short of transformative.

They deserve some extra support because burn out is SO real at that point of a student’s life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-04T13:15:12.157864Z","guid":"bb0a540f-6e32-4b05-96ca-e43d44391265","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/199e212e6706ae8d61b28bb3fc70c07081f591ef","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5d1328977d0d9ad8bac6c94864ea142f6d5a6674","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ce9b230dba7952ba060a462d42da10c22a31e085","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/165c508f8915e37e6595fb4081d3fad10429fd38"},"guid":"885fecd8-e280-4107-8d41-16e5260d3f04","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-07-11T16:38:03.203791Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5df4c68043668417841d7ab4f62bde8433f4546c"},"guid":"c252b3ae-fa1b-4a14-8744-d1a36aa59ecd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:18:49.547506Z"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.815387,40.737771,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.815387,40.737771,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"935a92fb-8ef6-4d00-9dcf-8ca3332c2d4e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2097012af204f501de9d94c6e26d2c55b3ae5533","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/57d18dad877f832f276a1455c43e8b1b31ce0926"},"guid":"5efd5ad4-0959-48c5-be42-2e27d13eeb8c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-11-21T17:00:39.740284Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5787461773700304,"count":1308},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://youtu.be/ADbciBGZEfA?si=JKC_T0cYUPFVBPqK"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-queens-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=cuny-queens-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://youtu.be/ADbciBGZEfA?si=JKC_T0cYUPFVBPqK"}]},{"guid":"8dc5069d-4c07-44bb-8a9c-87cf178842ad","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":581,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":37.678495,"lon":-97.366666},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Friends","alternates":{"ceeb":"6224","ipeds":"155089"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"8dc5069d-4c07-44bb-8a9c-87cf178842ad","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"WICHITA, KS","name":"Friends University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2ee536e0-4ea7-4ec4-a4ed-2b704ae6323b","gradSchool":"4e0fdf51-523b-449c-9354-907841277e3f","metroArea":"7a5a30af-8d17-4054-84a9-6e365732b5e6","neighborhood":"cebbe9d9-519a-48ae-a980-39c02f728234","state":"7c52d070-0372-43da-bc7f-d182b439866a","town":"01d9e450-a926-4a9b-babd-55d8afcd21fe","zipCode":"325347d7-231e-484a-bd9c-3c4cd8837ad2"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Friends University","tagline":["4 Year","WICHITA, KS"],"type":"College","url":"friends-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6324891908585547},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":23720},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at Friends University has been amazing!

To start with, the university is home to students from country around the world, making it the best place for learning different perspectives and cultures. This brings students together, and also motivates them to grow and learn together. In terms of academics, the support that professor gives to student’s success in their majors makes Lynchburg a community student to thrive personally and academically. To make academics more desirable, the university has a small classroom size between 20-25 students per class. This way, faculty members can prioritize each and every student present in class. There are also PASS leaders and solution centers other than professors to help students if they are struggling. However, the dining services and the variety of food options do not meet the needs of students. With this being improved, the rest of my experience at the University of Lynchburg has been fulfilling.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-06T04:15:44.543542Z","guid":"82da0f8a-e54f-4dd5-9643-7564fb5d7b1c","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/89b5f07be58a59b85297dd287960a0d1e7877b9e","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/511a252f8c9d8b54f87e1eb17cfdb3cbbab38600","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f27756874d33129e031265eb1dd72deddd436c1","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d8a8a3ba3c85e45d237b0378ad533f4f002167f5"},"guid":"a7cc7431-d861-4b3b-8d44-0a5b2c784a0d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-14T17:05:41.206427Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/02f6500db06f4843679711553448c9ef6a2ae85b"},"guid":"fbeb802a-ce86-41d7-9289-9e139791deda","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-11T16:20:32.591717Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.184153,37.397678,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.184153,37.397678,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"b400c365-f5f8-4b46-a994-1f4bd6c78cec","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c4564d4b14b0e8d720f93886989ec434bf8de9d0","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/90080d8ab8a061439569ab9c4c626dc82acdd6cc"},"guid":"46591532-5f8b-4b9e-be27-b335660302f1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-14T17:22:33.534783Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7066848567530695,"count":733},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tour.lynchburg.edu"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-lynchburg/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-lynchburg"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tour.lynchburg.edu"}]},{"guid":"81e60cee-853e-4ae7-a948-0784ad0f60dc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":585,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":37.478835,"lon":-82.520265},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Pikeville","alternates":{"ceeb":"1625","ipeds":"157535"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"81e60cee-853e-4ae7-a948-0784ad0f60dc","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"PIKEVILLE, KY","name":"University of Pikeville","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"4f6707a5-f4fa-4fce-b008-adaa1fa69862","gradSchool":"4069e1d7-68c8-49ab-b7d9-49b1428199d4","state":"27966205-db74-44e6-8d2d-79a4df61742a","town":"7e9e373a-689f-473e-9e7f-3fa5ee570ddb","zipCode":"c93c2016-60ab-4ceb-8376-f588d5b89a00"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UPIKE","tagline":["4 Year","PIKEVILLE, KY"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-pikeville","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17098},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I’ve loved being at UPike, I’ve met a lot of great people and have created amazing friendships!

It is a very nice small school in a great area with lots to do. There are some major downfalls with the school though. Currently, the food situation is AWFUL, with our main dining hall serving bad or even unsafe food commonly. Our other dining hall is pretty ok, but it doesn't have many options. The freshman residence halls are also questionable, but after you get out of those you're good, not to mention that our res life staff is AWFUL. There are a lot of clubs, sports, and other things to join and the student life is pretty good as well. If you can make friends and have a good time, its easier to see past those questionable aspects of the school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-15T01:55:57.46158Z","guid":"fdf3a328-2744-405c-a8d4-04956fb145ca","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/72f4f193c40010189e8f81d4b6f1f17e7e97fd3f","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a05a5e58aeaa152aac552a69accf461893105bd1","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/da650a69f64fa02f960ffdd5ea7c85fa26555981","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4b5d8c98f62cf022e491db58a87aff17160f118d"},"guid":"ff2f458e-f2c6-4e0a-8fc7-c71e0ec4be8c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-17T22:19:53.58012Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/607471fc62d4981f4d178c1872a22e4965ddf9b4"},"guid":"ccf182d9-9723-4c26-8880-245d6cde7ff6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-03T16:08:16.455902Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.158376,39.166058,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.158376,39.166058,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"8d541ff4-64e3-4bb8-a266-ea5fac6409e9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/19947867a98067ea9a1b2b0b1fa9f7ea3456247f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e052ff91c8db2490b70fca677963850232adb9ac"},"guid":"ea91be21-8031-43bd-b0fa-86ec31b8fdb0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-03T16:35:21.063543Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.649122807017544,"count":912},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.su.edu/experience/campus-location-tours/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/shenandoah-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=shenandoah-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.su.edu/experience/campus-location-tours/"}]},{"guid":"f46a30c2-802c-4e1d-ac12-4da00c620a52","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":587,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":30.094591,"lon":-95.992066},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Prairie View","alternates":{"ceeb":"6580","ipeds":"227526"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f46a30c2-802c-4e1d-ac12-4da00c620a52","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"PRAIRIE VIEW, TX","name":"Prairie View A & M University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"5d77fe05-4d2c-4a08-8507-3a29885b7739","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a7153460-b16f-476e-9c87-8cacc3eadcfb","gradSchool":"13afeac1-8d6f-45a1-a028-4085e6a4022f","parent":"5d77fe05-4d2c-4a08-8507-3a29885b7739","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"ea0be28f-dfc5-4be5-953c-d60d2dc06f2b","zipCode":"fd952b41-86ee-4984-90e0-e3f02ae1f142"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Prairie View","tagline":["4 Year","PRAIRIE VIEW, TX"],"type":"College","url":"prairie-view-a-and-m-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7606747496046389},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12875},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"860-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"Prairie View A&M is an amazing historical black college!

Bethel is in a residential area with shopping and restaurants nearby. The campus is beautifully maintained with  updated facilities. The athletics are competitive and participate in the MIAC, one of the most highly ranked conferences in the country. \n\nThe classes are excellent! Professors are approachable and willing to help and go above and beyond. The Couselors are knowlegeable and engaging. If they do not have an answer, they reach out to the person or department that can answer and solve any questions and/or issues.  \n\nBethel is a Christian Univeristy and has many outlets to learn and grow in your spirituality. There are religion classes, bible studies, Vespers, prayer groups, and church services among other clubs and activities.          \n\nI am more than satisified with my experience at Bethel University. I highly recommend attending.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-23T23:08:25.814316Z","guid":"f72d9dac-6f15-41a6-bb90-c31e681727f9","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ab9fb7ad9905180b46956c07286e81e77fee9b4","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d12ac64aad69e6b56777abf6e0816c9e82c95715","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5f6cb71097dd711d8f5933ce8a4d3e179f44914a","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bd674789e8cacfac4cb6acdf2fdf8226f2111017"},"guid":"f997b4c7-3080-488b-8299-a0ba4e3c2f62","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-12T01:09:57.049623Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/88741f92f8d649084542239c162d6a1c4bd213a0"},"guid":"3ec93440-0f8f-44fd-83ee-e074a259412f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-11T20:52:51.140643Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.159295,45.057091,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.159295,45.057091,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"521939ea-79f8-45e8-ba35-7e54c1e106d3","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5d66992fc3293087ba31e1fc479fde60224a5f23","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4309431e11bbd4849ed21d56a839805741c0444b"},"guid":"adc5cd98-83bc-4257-bc9b-93979f450144","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-12T19:51:05.78359Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.73109243697479,"count":833},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.bethel.edu/undergrad/admissions/visit/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bethel-university-minnesota/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=bethel-university-minnesota"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.bethel.edu/undergrad/admissions/visit/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},{"guid":"01a78443-7ab0-4bd6-8ca6-7398458c4684","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":594,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.350005,"lon":-119.104711},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Cal State Bakersfield","alternates":{"ceeb":"4110","ipeds":"110486"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"01a78443-7ab0-4bd6-8ca6-7398458c4684","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"BAKERSFIELD, CA","name":"California State University - Bakersfield","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"62c3f052-ef24-4213-884c-c6d5c7a4da16","gradSchool":"8e96ae7f-3a27-44c4-a630-e63eab6dfb78","metroArea":"0ad8fa33-8f16-451b-9c43-ea3a1cce789f","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"41f1c485-e509-4489-9979-591f1e71313c","zipCode":"bc7b4161-8450-4c87-b354-2524f940be0b"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Cal State Bakersfield","tagline":["4 Year","BAKERSFIELD, CA"],"type":"College","url":"california-state-university-bakersfield","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8654763625849357},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":7521},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended CSUB from 2011-2015 and my overall experience was great!

The professors are available and committed to teaching students effectively. There are 2 major POC Programs called SMP and EOP that are excellent for diverse students! I enjoyed my days on campus as I dorm there, and the community and town is very welcoming and kind to new people. However there are many issues with the life on campus. To list a handful, the dorm life is underwhelming and cramped spaces do not aid with the overall experience. The RA's try their best to host events with the limited budgets they have but many events aren't planned or hosted well. The dining hall and campus food is abysmal, and the cost to buy food off campus is extremely expensive. There is a strong predominantly white student body, with many staff being predominantly white as well. Overall, I have only spent 1 semester there so far but from my experience on campus I would like to see more focus put into listening to the student body.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-14T00:06:38.425615Z","guid":"69e8b90f-d86a-4bfe-a110-88325aa146b1","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a876177447c892f75baf9133558c43da008fea93","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6870e20845ed09430d10bfe5891edc56eda4fc91","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5dbba1b5e558e6bfce4f7b6bd67fe5c5694075e6","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/64f1b44f1688368ab80820a6759ad6e26add34fb"},"guid":"858be1d4-c098-4909-a607-97459a41892b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-19T19:30:07.664104Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b1e9b1bcc9507228e4c7ccbbfb447e6ce09c8a6e"},"guid":"d04d05d5-d511-40c5-8ed7-0f23cfbb4003","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-19T20:04:48.751843Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"0d959a65-9528-49de-880e-c0ad2907549b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a8bb30dbafa0b082feac77c06c478252ef33887","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/08872c91b6fd1f358bade34482148588e72ee6d1"},"guid":"8ff03afd-f88d-4190-ad76-f6c8eab9b4d1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-01-18T15:22:27.543596Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.66754617414248,"count":1516},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.newpaltz.edu/admissions/virtualtour.html"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-new-paltz/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=suny-new-paltz"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.newpaltz.edu/admissions/virtualtour.html"}]},{"guid":"95453266-65bb-4e29-beaa-c7ce5590d822","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":596,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.957017,"lon":-93.074153},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Metro","alternates":{"ceeb":"1245","ipeds":"174020"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"95453266-65bb-4e29-beaa-c7ce5590d822","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"SAINT PAUL, MN","name":"Metropolitan State University - Minnesota","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c13cddc-118e-48be-bb3b-bb9f32740b57","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"9300a4be-3cfa-41d1-b4ec-da53975b9679","gradSchool":"deb66b80-e83d-4d45-b340-3253e671d06f","metroArea":"b9517c86-f92e-4a8e-ac5f-e7530b9c2636","neighborhood":"4ea06661-ab29-4c22-8405-5704e238e5a8","onlineChild":"1478095d-e72b-42d7-9a34-29ce6cc60850","parent":"1c13cddc-118e-48be-bb3b-bb9f32740b57","state":"534cd634-543d-4983-89c3-22323ac74f77","town":"75904604-cbcb-40a4-961c-4694af629157","zipCode":"d7d94b0a-4356-48e3-8a96-28e319bb838c"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Metropolitan State","tagline":["4 Year","SAINT PAUL, MN"],"type":"College","url":"metropolitan-state-university-minnesota","variation":9},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8169934640522876},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19347},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Small class sizes so you get to directly engage with your professors, which is very nice. I've always had excellent and very approachable professors, although I have heard stories from others who have been less lucky. Overall, I really like this school.\nA few things I would like to see change is a wider science program--especially within physics. They currently do not offer a physics major, and minoring in physics is difficult due to their narrow range of physics courses. The few physics courses they do offer are amazing, though.\nThe other, maybe more minor annoyance, is that they literally never close no matter how terrible the weather is. They say it themselves that many courses only have 1-3 classes each week, so even missing one class can have a massive impact. Yet, they won't close even when we are deep in the negatives with possible -40 wind chills and all other schools are closed. If you have an older car that won't start under these conditions, this poses a real challenge.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-18T13:37:19.047263Z","guid":"eb08f83a-3a03-4b71-a05b-c8bc65a8954b","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2c6ef005b9a74dafdc876b24af892c2ba4e8d21d","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6f40277ecc80bb09049d8ad6545edaac4040302a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2c6ef005b9a74dafdc876b24af892c2ba4e8d21d","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/27ca9324691813c95c12f7178bca5c562089f445"},"guid":"1a2de587-36bd-4c92-9024-888d1ca3ac23","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.074153,44.957017,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.074153,44.957017,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3bd0a5d5-42e5-43b0-9407-cfbf56edfaa9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.66015625,"count":512},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/metropolitan-state-university-minnesota/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=metropolitan-state-university-minnesota"}]},{"guid":"be55a524-961a-4400-b925-56f2a4723a9e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":597,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.518495,"lon":-85.661991},"entity":{"abbreviation":"IWU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1446","ipeds":"151801"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"be55a524-961a-4400-b925-56f2a4723a9e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"MARION, IN","name":"Indiana Wesleyan University-Marion","parentGUIDs":{"college":"e2e93c40-f6eb-430c-a491-80812cce6c56","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c7bbc65c-54e6-4c55-a681-dae000a8d863","gradSchool":"f385a57c-68b4-4a7f-8e6d-9ffce01ea7ee","parent":"e2e93c40-f6eb-430c-a491-80812cce6c56","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"93d7cd0f-645b-419c-8f07-873ee5bef13d","zipCode":"73b42f1b-9e82-43e0-a155-5d4ffd985c8f"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Indiana Wesleyan","tagline":["4 Year","MARION, IN"],"type":"College","url":"indiana-wesleyan-university-marion","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8672072985301571},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":21755},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1000-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I am currently a junior at Indiana Wesleyan University.

As for me the food could use some work, the process of rooming can be stressful, and sometimes the professors can be slightly frustrating. Though everyone is trying their hardest to set you up to for success to the best of their ability. In my experience I have been fortunate enough to have gained friends that have become family. I am also so thankful that this campus and the committees provide things to do almost every weekend. As well as since this is a smaller school, the sports meets are typically more intimate and fun. I especially love the basketball games. What I would like to see changed though is the staff being more proactive about problems that arise. Sometimes they do little to respond to issues or do nothing at all which can be very frustrating. This is probably the main and biggest issue. Overall, though, I have loved it here, the Community is amazing, and everyone has been super helpful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-26T22:12:38.535353Z","guid":"1d58bae3-49d3-4343-a1f7-5958a2b17a12","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/858900c2dfa781a035ccbe33cede4cd6dd8039e6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/651af4bf3320a4a6e41b170a35f108c5e1fbffe7.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/858900c2dfa781a035ccbe33cede4cd6dd8039e6.jpg"},"guid":"a092570e-d471-41c0-81ec-c6ef998026ae","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2cc3de75b3f688169c909a2e8b5b59f81735f55f"},"guid":"e55558a9-9302-43d7-8d8e-0f08c2506aa5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-11-28T15:19:18.943112Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.189077,34.289254,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.189077,34.289254,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"dbdcc3ce-d509-4037-9b99-3fe61d0fcf9d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0190790d7c92328841f4571951994fd7a438f5eb","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5de08a1b5630a49e142b4731db864e26cc1e760a"},"guid":"e4e28992-e480-420c-ab34-bfceb99dee6d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-03-05T13:13:28.353134Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7196029776674937,"count":806},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.berry.edu/admission/tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/berry-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=berry-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.berry.edu/admission/tour"}]},{"guid":"a4124168-46e5-474a-80d2-96972a4b141d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":600,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":21.353359,"lon":-158.062444},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UH West Oahu","alternates":{"ceeb":"1042","ipeds":"141981"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"a4124168-46e5-474a-80d2-96972a4b141d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"KAPOLEI, HI","name":"University of Hawaii - West Oahu","parentGUIDs":{"college":"93001121-c35c-4bdb-9ff1-569ff07e86d0","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6c09d9f8-a7ec-4a81-95eb-facbd9b9cc37","metroArea":"ac4e8ceb-d4f2-4427-b642-da6f57ca97e4","onlineChild":"47c3cbf6-4c60-45ff-b6f3-87ba419dcf0f","parent":"93001121-c35c-4bdb-9ff1-569ff07e86d0","state":"0278a07c-335b-4da6-9271-9c0d5b989617","town":"5a30dd46-726f-4d7c-b29e-4d3c098ce214","zipCode":"fc88d8f9-7fc4-4e04-a8bf-cab235eea7a7"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"UH West Oahu","tagline":["4 Year","KAPOLEI, HI"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-hawaii-west-oahu","variation":9},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9630459126539753},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":9103},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1040-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"When I first moved to Hawaii and finished my high school year in Kapolei High School, I decided to enroll in University of Hawaii. My first year of college came very steadily with no issues with aligning with the school's education system. I took my first class in the summer to get some classes done before I officially enrolled full time. I had classes in UH West Oahu, but also some classes at the sister community college Leeward College. The classes were no issue for me and my previous professors are relatively generous with how they operate their classes. The location is close to home and now that the skyline was finished right after my graduation from high school, I was able to go to the Leeward campus. The campus is mainly outdoor with a nice field of grass and a cheap and plentiful food court. I've sometimes stop by the court to eat some Hawaiian inspired meat meals. The service at the food court is rather quick, with no issues with the condition or pricing.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-28T04:36:40.497279Z","guid":"f84d9d10-99ed-4fa2-b6cd-6e7189b09b7b","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/600235df1fcd234a4ff53f4cbb242e2a1f353df1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/145cdcb73cd262d32341d6c59371739afe98ff94.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/600235df1fcd234a4ff53f4cbb242e2a1f353df1.jpg"},"guid":"39742d68-0e41-46a2-84e0-b592c9ccbc4a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ebeca4d3c65e26029f44a7c196fb8a0b72bf2442"},"guid":"cce253c8-0f9a-4951-b544-c3fd781aac59","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T20:40:08.025188Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-158.062444,21.353359,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-158.062444,21.353359,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f581dabd-f25a-4641-969b-1a20a3238df9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.747191011235955,"count":356},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-west-oahu/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-hawaii-west-oahu"}]},{"guid":"f5fef79a-eeb9-490d-ad80-b8c5acf87dc4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":601,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":46.859423,"lon":-96.765567},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Concordia College","alternates":{"ceeb":"6113","ipeds":"173300"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f5fef79a-eeb9-490d-ad80-b8c5acf87dc4","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MOORHEAD, MN","name":"Concordia College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"be978427-cb54-4cfe-8c79-2c4e524c434c","gradSchool":"35f50f24-52c4-4e3e-ae74-2c49ca88091b","metroArea":"3dee2319-622c-47cd-8abb-891886beb7a0","state":"534cd634-543d-4983-89c3-22323ac74f77","town":"9fdae91a-257c-4fb5-88df-6592c869b9ea","zipCode":"87aa267a-f1a2-4521-b99a-ed5e7eb0dfb0"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Concordia College","tagline":["4 Year","MOORHEAD, MN"],"type":"College","url":"concordia-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6551539491298527},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":23087},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"A hidden gem up in NW Minnesota, Concordia College boasts incredible academics led by professors who genuinely care about their students, a vibrant campus community (most students come from far away so don't expect an empty campus on weekends), tons to get involved in and do, and an affordable smaller, up-and-coming city.

So far my experience has been fantastic. Being familiar with college tours, application and financial aid process im really happy with how smooth this process has been with UMass Boston. Although I won't be living on campus i did have the opportunity to tour one of the dorms and was highly impressed. The views from any number of campus locations are beautiful and inspiring. Any incoming freshman should definitely try to live on campus at least a semester or two. I met with an admission specialist who was friendly patient and informed. I look forward to emersing myself back into the college experience and with a diverse group of equally thrilled students of all ages im sure.

Always something happening on campus, it is a great place to live. Parking is okay, best spots are probably in the village, and everything is accessible. However, there are often broken doors or elevators out of order that don’t get fixed for a long time and make certain areas harder to access for disabled students. Public Safety loves giving out tickets to any cars not showing their passes, have a system to look up if you paid for one, and still give tickets. The appeals are almost always approved, making the whole thing extremely frustrating for no reason. Very rough hill to climb if you’re wheelchair-bound or otherwise have impaired mobility, recommend living on campus. Some professors truly want to see you succeed, while others are determined to make their exams impossible. Very difficult to buy necessities without a car. Shuttle goes off campus to local center but may make you late for class, be aware!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-19T15:59:22.799849Z","guid":"16f04186-8714-428b-be09-028bd203ce47","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b7319eb957c75612227a579d1490764f95da0df8","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ce08d9ab1e4d8fe442310aad2c704d638c713403","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ec42a5eb1c57c68a859a4475f84cb19802c3c9e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ef2cb1b37c641e06c1e370af2ed672239b8f4674"},"guid":"e862c015-6735-490a-a683-fcf32baa6c50","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-15T22:15:40.955431Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f72dfc478b39c1500e11439bdc6b33c07e00e809"},"guid":"0c8d44fb-aa45-44fe-8dfd-48ff710bdbdd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T20:37:25.239988Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.178,41.0819,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.178,41.0819,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"b423aec5-7ba3-41ab-80b5-b5fbd17ebacc","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e846c11a1a4427c1c8164dd433e9ef32eaec84f1","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b01e0c5c762e10ec81a8c3054d7116d0928901d5"},"guid":"cad52596-a314-498f-b475-7c6b693ae024","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-13T18:19:55.531311Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.457516339869281,"count":1071},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.ramapo.edu/tours"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ramapo-college-of-new-jersey/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=ramapo-college-of-new-jersey"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.ramapo.edu/tours"}]},{"guid":"be4029b3-01be-4384-b24e-a20bcf1fc4aa","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":605,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.083868,"lon":-106.620155},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UNM","alternates":{"ipeds":"187985"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"be4029b3-01be-4384-b24e-a20bcf1fc4aa","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"ALBUQUERQUE, NM","name":"University of New Mexico","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"4acb935d-2d2e-439a-b718-6cd95fd655e7","gradSchool":"7bbce3bf-0dc4-425a-b63a-9bc27a99a415","metroArea":"1c4a0461-43d6-4b57-b473-f12b42bb1018","neighborhood":"c995b433-5a80-4918-8e62-4a660783fb6d","onlineChild":"ccaf3587-08ba-4a7f-9043-40ae6bdc8c93","state":"b5b20bc1-cdf6-4591-bfad-062d30c2154a","town":"bc18684d-7377-4be5-89b7-1a847c0a7dc4","zipCode":"fe9d8458-04e0-4779-88e1-b233e7591892"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"New Mexico","tagline":["4 Year","ALBUQUERQUE, NM"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-new-mexico","variation":5},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9606772687712636},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10633},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1030-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This is a very great school that has a lot of diversity! It also gives a lot of financial aid, especially for in-state students. It’s cheap to study here for a nationally ranked school (4th in the US for health primary care). As a business major and honor student, I have had wonderful professors and student teachers. Everything is very fair academically, I haven’t had any issues with an instructor. UNM has a strong sense of community and support in relation to safety and mental health. Also, UNM has a very cohesive layout, and is very scenic and quiet, making it perfect for studying. However, something I would love to see improvement on is the communication with academic departments as a whole. It’s very difficult to find contact information and ask questions. The website for UNM is unreliable due to outdated information or just lack of information.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-19T05:55:49.756201Z","guid":"40b69cea-4a3c-477f-a7f1-da5b9823a422","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fd27ed57a80704f3415725ea01aced96648895ee","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15a785753884e835e3cf3dd454cd657d563b8420","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/53c3059e034a1764560a2880c75c892f8ffd173e","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d0ea35219ca0b577cee829a3f3086369dc84602"},"guid":"f581d340-52cf-4756-889b-c2f6e5784f07","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/06fae713ef616d2c833976b314b0384c39a01248"},"guid":"d1d91bef-8adc-478d-90cf-600ec78efc27","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"af712c0c-0e57-4332-bd63-4f962d8921b2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5709146968139773,"count":3892},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://campustour.unm.edu/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-mexico/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-new-mexico"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://campustour.unm.edu/"}]},{"guid":"ae969791-109e-4a34-ae29-02d1efb43d3b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":606,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.653724,"lon":-121.799216},"entity":{"abbreviation":"CSUMB","alternates":{"ceeb":"1945","ipeds":"409698"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"ae969791-109e-4a34-ae29-02d1efb43d3b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SEASIDE, CA","name":"California State University - Monterey Bay","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"f007357f-7f52-4531-8fcf-76b58a8787b2","gradSchool":"2cb40d7a-7ea2-4d51-97dc-1fbedcb072ce","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"14ec59ac-8745-4fd0-9428-74fcc3a2e256","zipCode":"d8d6d2e8-ab49-4eb9-930f-4bedbcd90fd8"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Cal State Monterey Bay","tagline":["4 Year","SEASIDE, CA"],"type":"College","url":"california-state-university-monterey-bay","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9238542329726289},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":11435},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Being at CSUMB has, overall, been a really great experience.

I feel safe and welcomed in every part of the campus here, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about their options for college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-21T04:13:55.869201Z","guid":"f18607c3-0244-47be-8227-587f93824ec0","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/09fd46b3a2eaa23c844b17a966c1cf1a17f28d21","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4d5582bb80b2ac5ea20bd65bc1040b60ca833d6d","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9692175968e3b9c55e2dcf11c344e623b2663fa6","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0fffb62823b2089875797403f0c084037a38a769"},"guid":"ba8efb13-a056-43b4-b172-06d3dc92fb1a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-05T21:55:49.310787Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4d86620b5986973f3c96e70db0d9e7ed10577338"},"guid":"c69059f5-ecb7-48dc-8a1f-f72422592bec","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.799216,36.653724,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.799216,36.653724,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"ef3282db-b198-4cc1-9566-2fb97c957d44","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/673ecfdb3c32f59f604da4a49fed328f51885297","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/91e7118a1fba142e039df79d94b6a1592975a196"},"guid":"2324a9e2-b91d-445e-8751-bd0300332ef1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5412995594713657,"count":1816},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://vr.peekpeek.com/csumb/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university-monterey-bay/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-state-university-monterey-bay"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://vr.peekpeek.com/csumb/"}]},{"guid":"7142f38c-9d62-4173-9c4d-dc2da081a40f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":607,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.725279,"lon":-119.731953},"entity":{"abbreviation":"FPU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4616","ipeds":"114813"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7142f38c-9d62-4173-9c4d-dc2da081a40f","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"FRESNO, CA","name":"Fresno Pacific University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"62495dd3-f373-4720-95f1-16f84257fd1c","gradSchool":"4fbfc99f-724b-4eb7-81fa-905d04302cc6","metroArea":"7bec0613-2091-4a80-bc89-2ce15328d607","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"ae387a06-8a42-4ee4-9094-c865781316fa","zipCode":"26b3a182-56fc-4d17-a381-f29686a3ba35"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Fresno Pacific","tagline":["4 Year","FRESNO, CA"],"type":"College","url":"fresno-pacific-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.75},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":15255},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"970-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Fresno Pacific University has undoubtedly been the best choice I could have made for my college education.

Take a tour, I'm sure you'll find that Fisher could be exactly what you're looking for.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-02T19:17:12.228476Z","guid":"e637662f-61af-44bc-b696-7185454e03b0","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f5bcfef129581b79728547332fd2b1d108119b8","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/808193f8cfa7547adb95e47225230e6ea15a09bd","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f5bcfef129581b79728547332fd2b1d108119b8","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70c8d2904e0579f79b2dd73cb4d353af80efdd90"},"guid":"f558d8bb-084e-468f-998d-ad1380bc13b6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5f9277b3b715738f83f86cc7fcb44fcbe924bb6d"},"guid":"70bfa412-b2bd-4c44-92ff-b5806ad98074","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-10T17:37:10.991153Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.516979,43.117064,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.516979,43.117064,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d7442ce3-a14f-440c-aa1b-9454ede072fd","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3a1bac87d4d84f5f067f60dae40edb1702749391","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b04644fa3169634aefdf37874899dbb2c92e0917"},"guid":"817509f8-96ec-4f5f-b326-e2075b4a6091","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-10T17:41:12.317186Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7246376811594204,"count":621},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/iBKhWDpLO/stop/1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-john-fisher-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=st-john-fisher-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tour.concept3d.com/share/iBKhWDpLO/stop/1"}]},{"guid":"8a72c13a-3ea9-44c2-a121-7a777fbc0aa5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":610,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.444651,"lon":-88.067301},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SNC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1706","ipeds":"239716"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"8a72c13a-3ea9-44c2-a121-7a777fbc0aa5","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"DE PERE, WI","name":"St. Norbert College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"00be83e4-c547-47e5-9f19-39e758f2405f","gradSchool":"6f126148-b3d6-42b7-ae62-b4579594db51","state":"963a1085-efe7-45f5-81ee-d2bbf82a907c","town":"1a47478c-0805-4a5e-95b1-65d2f35ee6ee","zipCode":"1c2826e8-6c00-4e57-b781-bf1896facfd2"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"St. Norbert","tagline":["4 Year","DE PERE, WI"],"type":"College","url":"st-norbert-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8395570435230492},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":26983},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1010-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I like that St. Norbert College is smaller so you really get to know your professors and other students. I like that campus is next to the water and is a nicer and safe area. I feel comfortable walking by myself at night. The professors are easy to get ahold of if you need help and its such a comfortable place. I would like to see changes in areas of academics. With the increased tuition and cuts they had this year, a lot of students or professors were let go and transferred. This unfortunately resulted in a cut in classes and now it feels like I'm behind in graduating. I would also change the food at school. Its pretty good but definitely hurts stomaches with most of the food being breaded, fried, oiled etc. Feeding that to athletes, students with dietary issues, and even a regular student that is trying not to have the freshmen 15, it can be frustrating. However, I have a feeling a lot of other schools are facing the same thing as well.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-15T17:53:01.905926Z","guid":"f2fcce97-5ab6-4172-a055-00d9db96adc3","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdef78852fd8483c0e01a169b923d76c48fbfe53","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6c3b3f82af525c2d6fc9e5e541e65fa73c312077","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f58b79b9b8d4eea66f433dd6b0afc1dc0f3b22f4","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aa23c1ce7251dfa8877a542096325fe02a9edf70"},"guid":"c98bd626-3819-4738-819d-7baf554794da","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-11T20:47:40.253807Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e18aca76d65ab5070db796cd0ce0e778a2012e89"},"guid":"0ae9042d-cea4-4133-9799-2c7be2c62c9a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-12-22T20:18:18.475784Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.067301,44.444651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.067301,44.444651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5bb035e2-8974-47d5-89bf-c7994a48b20e","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a49636307b71cc3fd9d8d7fe8623d32650e0480b","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1217cfec4946027a4aa227e0abce23eba47eba97"},"guid":"ee12550b-776f-4102-89ec-81b61227fa35","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-19T21:20:26.062585Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.798709677419355,"count":775},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.snc.edu/admission/visit-us/virtual-tour.html"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-norbert-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=st-norbert-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.snc.edu/admission/visit-us/virtual-tour.html"}]},{"guid":"e1990599-7e9f-480f-979c-92d0649abea8","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":611,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.072485,"lon":-78.894709},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Fayetteville","alternates":{"ceeb":"5212","ipeds":"198543"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"e1990599-7e9f-480f-979c-92d0649abea8","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"FAYETTEVILLE, NC","name":"Fayetteville State University","parentGUIDs":{"college":"ba52fd68-37e6-44af-b6b6-54e17fe1eaec","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e27ddefb-3d1d-4320-ac70-be76da2cce68","gradSchool":"2536c37c-a074-4d53-8f29-7223234dc7f7","metroArea":"8243539e-bfa9-4992-8870-8d3cc19e111d","parent":"ba52fd68-37e6-44af-b6b6-54e17fe1eaec","state":"6c719699-2dd3-4c44-9fc0-2d38b35cc1c8","town":"34aa2251-5a66-4b16-9628-ca342ea56cf1","zipCode":"bda5d81a-3ddc-452e-9737-7dce6772094b"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Fayetteville State","tagline":["4 Year","FAYETTEVILLE, NC"],"type":"College","url":"fayetteville-state-university","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8123936816524909},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":6355},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"My experience at Fayetteville State University was largely positive, with several outstanding aspects.

Most restaurants serve pizza, wings, burgers, and sandwiches, with a few Asian spots as well. \nStudent housing can be hit or miss depending on the building, with the new buildings being better. Off-campus housing is affordable and living within walking distance of campus is ideal since parking without a pass can be difficult.\nAs a homebody, I spent much time indoors, in the library, or study rooms with friends. I worked on campus as a student worker, delivering mail and packages to various offices, which helped me connect with staff and gain valuable experience. I'd recommend that students take time to network, as it could open up many opportunities.\nThe professors I've had are engaging - two even took us out for pizza and drinks at the end of the year.\nIf I could change one thing, it would be to add more parking for students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-15T03:26:25.94949Z","guid":"39c74ff5-c547-40bd-8d73-660d6b3eafae","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2a67ff6486b42c8feab7de8aa4901af5131fee1","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b777a7987ff0e4d76fe5451a1e5490ef1eaf830","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7efa7249f9bc665a1293f93509b8c27e49ecbdd9","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e3439c183a9426f8c9cb9012556fa514a723464c"},"guid":"1fd1d5ad-91b8-4008-80f5-ec6793c1f958","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-05T16:41:59.341907Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70eeff7ebdb68e07db920a465f082ab442ca8f0f"},"guid":"8857fbb4-0191-4044-bd7d-db47bf41db33","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-09-05T19:38:23.601135Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.64447,44.046572,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.64447,44.046572,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3a032943-a2cd-4208-909d-0665dc6d003b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/80d2f36dd7a30a0c3d2fb7a90afc57adb21bfc0e","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efbab6a97325b89076a576330a85e0413739e949"},"guid":"692373fe-1111-416e-bca1-2fc43382fc4c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6862139917695473,"count":972},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://blogs.winona.edu/admissions/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/winona-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=winona-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://blogs.winona.edu/admissions/virtual-campus-tour/"}]},{"guid":"c0d9a4a8-43ed-4590-9527-f49b93ea17e0","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":618,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":30.694751,"lon":-88.138199},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SHC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1733","ipeds":"102234"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"c0d9a4a8-43ed-4590-9527-f49b93ea17e0","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"MOBILE, AL","name":"Spring Hill College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"fdf48208-1df4-448c-9781-3b83bc603b92","gradSchool":"f96d20f6-3c04-4cfc-b5cd-3a492b53868d","metroArea":"f6811044-f90b-4453-ad5b-fd35c6581bb1","onlineChild":"c5ef824c-8a1c-45e3-8288-210c2633ede6","state":"bcace3a7-dc8b-437b-a107-4499869a449a","town":"9b90e3c1-b450-45d9-8886-559bd24a37e2","zipCode":"5177c416-431c-41ee-aab5-a0f4c9824f96"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Spring Hill","tagline":["4 Year","MOBILE, AL"],"type":"College","url":"spring-hill-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7263414634146341},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":21018},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1110-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Spring Hill is a Jesuit experience through and through.

Mobile and area are a great place to go to college... beach, coast, concerts, trips to New Orleans, fishing. etc.  Socially, Spring Hill creates many friends.  While kids at larger schools join fraternities/sororities and keep to themselves the Badger way is - yeah, join a fraternity or sorority if you want, they're fun. But all kids socialize together.   Don't need to be Greek to have many friends, be part of the social life.  Academically, great focus on classics education which breeds thinkers.

However, the school leans more toward a traditional, old-school approach to education.\n\nMany professors follow conventional methods; for instance, only a few use slides or offer Zoom classes. If a student misses a class due to athletic commitments, they must rely on their classmates for notes or turn to the textbook, as recordings or supplemental materials are not typically provided. Additionally, grades are not consistently updated throughout the term—they are only made available during midterms and finals week.\n\nThat said, the school excels in many ways. It offers great professors, small class sizes, and a conducive learning environment that fosters academic growth. Overall, it’s a fantastic institution for those who value a traditional, community-oriented education experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-17T15:11:50.18924Z","guid":"61fee44b-1e6e-4c47-a73d-15875effe003","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1a0c8af733eefa9a46c08c5eaee3ebda6df1f246","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b17b184e13b69baea05b4b5f979746c9e063104a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f412e737fb4071463baed21e670a81e9ebfc876a","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cb3be282a191e55c7f698db65b6c888a3866ac54"},"guid":"23260f99-db72-4a5f-ab37-02b6b20da8aa","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-14T14:42:59.385261Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb45852c186bfc53366a7146b4267196fb610406"},"guid":"f804b160-2e33-4659-91bd-b91673c18198","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.188231,38.777278,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.188231,38.777278,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"b4b196ab-ad72-4660-8c4a-1d76464344a2","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0b46a9f950ad344fbfe2c88c29c1081736cb5f46","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20cd37194811aab679570c1f910a07fc94ff2cac"},"guid":"329d35cb-bfd2-43f5-8798-4903a769671a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-18T19:38:30.841995Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.569548872180451,"count":532},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.bakeru.edu/tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/baker-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=baker-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.bakeru.edu/tour/"}]},{"guid":"b4e1e7f4-34dd-4731-a21a-2c470bee2121","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":621,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.021803,"lon":-73.906243},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Bard","alternates":{"ceeb":"2037","ipeds":"189088"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b4e1e7f4-34dd-4731-a21a-2c470bee2121","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, NY","name":"Bard College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ea607422-46a3-43c5-9246-ad2200db4df3","gradSchool":"3449ef22-6189-452b-99ac-fd0f6095554f","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"8471f4b1-4b26-4df7-8690-0029806c6de5","zipCode":"3d85c746-7238-4143-9d22-00a8e40346c5"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Bard","tagline":["4 Year","ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, NY"],"type":"College","url":"bard-college","variation":5},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.46081456340635607},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":25214},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Bard is an excellent institution with exception professors, course offerings and guidance.

The food choices offered in campus dining are certainly limited but not inedible.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-13T00:17:46.214226Z","guid":"45ec8c2f-801d-4618-ac37-5fcb8af21ecc","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b67e87702783828ea95f6cdf10335f3766651b58","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a368ee98aa7f1710abda85b6c503273cbbec9af","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b9e2c73abb506591ac12690c58f519e5899b6de","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68bde9ee83a1f3e864b63dbc43357ef1894cc638"},"guid":"d779f96a-2da2-41f9-bf0b-ec6c2daf0083","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-01T18:40:51.194239Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efcbf0f2d39f632216eca1a64cb09b342193ec55"},"guid":"5a92cc91-f3c3-4d1c-b3da-34841bdb8937","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-12-05T15:56:23.915745Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.474392,38.302206,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.474392,38.302206,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"1d210da5-3dfa-4dcc-985f-2bedad2a0b22","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d305685955cf9ff61e0a9ac1c7471bae038510e3","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/96078da56953788c26b6a18b6ebf61eddfd68fd8"},"guid":"1c8808d2-c71f-4fd1-bb16-59c609911895","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-28T13:30:15.633275Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1759880686055184,"count":1341},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/umw"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-mary-washington/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-mary-washington"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/umw"}]},{"guid":"9aba6326-ea18-4571-83ae-9d7926b8c9c3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":623,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.132713,"lon":-79.046229},"entity":{"abbreviation":"NU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2558","ipeds":"193973"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"9aba6326-ea18-4571-83ae-9d7926b8c9c3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NIAGARA UNIVERSITY, NY","name":"Niagara University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c6eab7a0-441e-40f4-a95a-dd5317e607fe","gradSchool":"1e8bbd2e-b20b-4cf2-acaa-a2f96b32b39b","metroArea":"93770a15-987e-4750-be2f-945cbfe930e7","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"f93e87a3-5ca4-4bf8-8af6-22da0fc9480b","zipCode":"708ebff0-f5f8-458d-bcab-e1acc08543e7"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Niagara","tagline":["4 Year","NIAGARA UNIVERSITY, NY"],"type":"College","url":"niagara-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8954640250260688},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":18165},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1030-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Niagara University.

My professors are all well-versed in the subjects they are educating us in. Professors are always available either via email, phone or in person. \n\nNow the snow and cold are something to adjust to, especially being a Texan. It was manageable due to the local friends you will make at the University. I have made friendships that will last a lifetime and I am so grateful.

But other than that, the college is very ideal for someone who is looking for a good education and to succeed in their work of study.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-25T17:24:52.68619Z","guid":"6fbd3e9e-5306-4a28-9627-5318a0ca0d36","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d552c2c8eae20517e7773faec4439dc9463b7d24","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3fdf6ddfffeec8008df7278bfd009a5b2b7d760f","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cff507b80641cc2a4c9480553034aab852613532","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b77471f6ea3850a4d073ac9979198a39162327e2"},"guid":"43e1f8c9-663b-416f-bfe6-579942672800","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-07T20:43:13.318312Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/054731796507d68d4fe02d0d097bf8667e1cfc25"},"guid":"b79d98b5-d03e-4216-922b-986120324d2d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-18T19:41:04.394935Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.583974,42.055364,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.583974,42.055364,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"75dba0d4-db05-47db-b046-0f536ed88fda","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aa5393602e6f5b6f2150653bc7dbfe374efc5391","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/719b6aece6f387eb2cb739e04f8a75f13288c2bb"},"guid":"eb78e85e-30e7-492d-9010-bb3cb4acc052","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-04-18T16:30:23.779311Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.831223628691983,"count":711},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/59845/79860"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bay-path-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=bay-path-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/59845/79860"}]},{"guid":"5429db04-f778-44a5-899c-1bc7848631d7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":626,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.344765,"lon":-75.971016},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"MU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2087","ipeds":"214069"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"5429db04-f778-44a5-899c-1bc7848631d7","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"DALLAS, PA","name":"Misericordia University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2e2b0074-eaf6-45f8-800a-440bb6fcb657","gradSchool":"a92c2ad3-1f9c-47c7-accf-0ff52d777be3","metroArea":"e6068a69-3a78-47d6-8a05-ee65f9915dfc","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","zipCode":"985e4369-6790-4ca6-ad8a-e9b4f2ac846e"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Misericordia","tagline":["4 Year","DALLAS, PA"],"type":"College","url":"misericordia-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8870673952641166},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":27033},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1050-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The thing that sets MU apart from other colleges I seen is the involvement on the college, there is always something to do with the events they host.

One of the things I really liked about Hunter College is the quality of the faculty. Many professors are passionate about their subjects and bring a wealth of real-world experience to their teaching. The campus is also conveniently located in Manhattan, which provides great opportunities for internships and cultural experiences.\n\nHowever, there are some areas that could use improvement. For instance, the administrative processes can sometimes be slow and cumbersome, which can be frustrating for students.

Many schools don’t speak or mention immigration at all but CSUSM has signs saying ”immigrants are welcome here”. I like how CSUSM doesn’t shy away from saying these sorts of these, many schools would consider that political and refrain from even mentioning immigration as casually as that. I also like the EOP staff and any program staff in general. All workers here are very attentive, patient, and thorough. Another thing I like is the campus etiquette.

Many of them do not know how to advise us.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-09T17:42:33.308837Z","guid":"2e294ed5-3ea5-4013-aa78-b67ad068e85f","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45cb79fe27fa02739f7ca4eb22b3a721c9ca4a45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d335a4b8bf95efce71fa4e813b48d3699ded5bc4.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45cb79fe27fa02739f7ca4eb22b3a721c9ca4a45.jpg"},"guid":"dc8053d3-b3d8-44e2-8f87-c37ad7ba5bbb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"8cd06f0d-877f-40ae-9a6f-ff3ee68d65da","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.695906432748538,"count":855},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-adventist-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=southern-adventist-university"}]},{"guid":"04c2f950-cb5f-4785-a8fc-dad897becd6d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":643,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.50363,"lon":-89.03147},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Beloit","alternates":{"ceeb":"1059","ipeds":"238333"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"04c2f950-cb5f-4785-a8fc-dad897becd6d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"BELOIT, WI","name":"Beloit College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"7aca2f56-d36e-429a-8002-4078b8200e7e","state":"963a1085-efe7-45f5-81ee-d2bbf82a907c","town":"f28e1ecc-4d6d-4024-8df7-5d6a2fde4331","zipCode":"46b06084-352b-4690-8590-2c281087a7bf"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Beloit","tagline":["4 Year","BELOIT, WI"],"type":"College","url":"beloit-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.658578856152513},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20192},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1190-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Overall, I love attending Beloit College.

U of I is 15k a year after applying aid AND scholarships. Note that most students receive 3x the national average in scholarships via niche’s quick facts. \n\nMost of us who choose private school do so to work one on one with faculty in our classes and when conducting research through independent studies. There are more full-time faculty than adjuncts many of whom in addition to holding PhDs have either worked as executives in major corporations for 20+ years or own their own business and teach full-time. That’s what makes St. Francis so valuable. You’re learning from subject matter experts. Classes are genuinely challenging. St. Francis is NOT a party school. You’ll spend most of your time studying. Admissions are selective for illinois. \n\nOnly downside is the location and the fact that the university is selective for Illinois so you occasionally get rage posts from people that were denied entry.

It's been a great time and I can't wait to make more memories and grow!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-12T03:14:42.898251Z","guid":"f91166c8-c10a-4305-b615-4612e0c08550","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9cfcbaf657414c4b452a5e9ae0832b0486de207e","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/94eac2c5489781c128b123b9dd4ed0f5ab8ff0ab","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/623c50d58c46c7261d59fbfb300cd3fed8cb97b1","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d2b81501f52a533b76cba7565be61bf074c43113"},"guid":"a5a10ccd-1e92-4e32-83b8-543458b0f908","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-07T15:57:06.749809Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3760aee681d92b1aa23c1401c6b5c3899b909e46"},"guid":"d1c06512-e410-49f1-a30f-afc4dc47a9c6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-07T16:42:08.677465Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.39,45.58,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.39,45.58,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"2f217bbd-d4dc-4915-8e3d-313f8a9da4dc","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48c4c78acad4259452e5f41681f99b5dc0fdcb23","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d70aaa1267fbc5d01a32b7fd061e2b05fa17adb"},"guid":"1c606a62-7ce2-4626-b395-3deb8e42f378","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-07T16:53:34.897022Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.707434052757794,"count":417},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.csbsju.edu/about/experience-campus/virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-johns-university-minnesota/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=saint-johns-university-minnesota"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.csbsju.edu/about/experience-campus/virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"24531f02-7d6d-4bef-a4f6-bac526ed3eaf","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":651,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.114337,"lon":-83.166581},"entity":{"abbreviation":"HU","alternates":{"ipeds":"203085"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"24531f02-7d6d-4bef-a4f6-bac526ed3eaf","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"TIFFIN, OH","name":"Heidelberg University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"b348dc4f-e292-47b1-b6d6-bf9ae36e8527","gradSchool":"2e6b02e5-6e41-4bf9-806a-1e7c41725edd","metroArea":"8e65bc72-5a8a-4de4-9b3b-451db0e48812","state":"e22ca9b6-60b3-461e-b905-42a3e83cbeb2","town":"b198932d-0a5c-41e3-bcd8-fbc2132f52ca","zipCode":"c0602260-f755-4060-968f-ed396f7b961c"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Heidelberg","tagline":["4 Year","TIFFIN, OH"],"type":"College","url":"heidelberg-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7138888888888889},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":20053},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Heidelberg has been a great experience for me, and has allowed me the opportunity to become my own person and gain the freedom to see what I like and dislike. The teachers so far have been amazing, there is always one teacher that isn't your favorite, but that will always be the case no matter where you are. I currently live in the only dorm on campus without AC, for the first few weeks it really sucked but since then it has been good. As a student athlete I learned more responsibility with managing my time, it also allowed me to meet a lot of people and gain a social life quickly after coming to campus. We have a ton of groups on campus and there are always events being held to meet new people, promote campus safety, and learn more about the groups and clubs. Overall I would recommend Heidelberg to anyone who was looking for academic success with a welcoming community of staff and students.

It is 100% online.  Many of the Ed.D programs will say they are online but then have a two-week summer \"retreat\" or a once-a-month Saturday class.  Not St. Ed's program.  If you are in higher edu or K-12 edu and are looking for a very flexible Ed.D program at a reasonable cost, look at this program.  It's not cheap, but it's also from a real university (celebrating its 140 anniversary).  I happen to live in Austin, where St. Ed's is located, but several of the people in my cohort are from outside of Austin and several out of state.  They follow a cohort model, so you will have many of your classes with the same students, which is nice. You really start to develop a relationship with your cohort.  There are two pathways in the Ed.D program, one in higher education and one in organizational change and leadership.  The organizational change pathway is best for you if you are not in HE or K-12.

The faculty truly makes the school. All the professors I have had have been vastly diverse in their methods of teaching, and each has taught me how to become a better college student. The class sizes, which usually don't surpass 25 students, have allowed me to connect with my peers easily and have facilitated the transition from high school. However, if there is one thing I would change, it would be the quality and maintenance of the dorms, as well as the food in the cafeteria. Some of the dorms should be renovated, while the food could use some more variety.

The professors I have encountered from the Visual Arts programs to the Environmental Science programs are all so passionate and educated about the topics they teach us everyday. The staff are kind and the campus is beautiful, small, but pretty cozy once you have a chance to get comfortable. The area is also exceptionally beautiful. However, as a black person and student there isn't as much diversity on campus as a student or person of color would hope for. Regardless, I have been able to meet some black and queer kids like me! Overall, I think the school is wonderful, not without its flaws, but still a good place to learn in an area I see myself calling home one day.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-26T03:37:18.141032Z","guid":"d02ba331-e7df-4a9a-801b-4c5d803e2396","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7a8fdcf2e7734a348fa2f6845baa6cfbaf14a0c2","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/88148f88bb356a4078162bf48cb5ccba2f678cfd","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6eb42c13d2838237650cdce4db3006379161a4db","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ea656d443cae6c05a1183f7de5db4ae53bbc15d"},"guid":"b3fb8a65-f7e9-4a29-a44a-e53e99f2a5fd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-30T16:36:37.41636Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d4424536dae6c2b0ed5b10251fd30887037b869"},"guid":"988628db-a556-445a-90eb-2a8ad04876d2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-30T16:50:06.120194Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.565259,35.616618,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.565259,35.616618,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"14fa6c5c-e0a5-4bd5-a7a7-c8b3c2c3a0b3","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0e2984b099c481d6ca92ce206c24287d4ea9d0e8","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/66ca1bdc6eb06a04122b40d6caecb6bb183da928"},"guid":"a65c2ad5-631b-443a-8da2-078d1f06d8cb","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-30T16:48:36.538364Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8275862068965516,"count":725},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/unca/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-asheville/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-north-carolina-asheville"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/unca/"}]},{"guid":"ffe91bed-0e98-41b2-8906-d20c215ff84b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":660,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.502918,"lon":-81.673052},"entity":{"abbreviation":"CSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1221","ipeds":"202134"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"ffe91bed-0e98-41b2-8906-d20c215ff84b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CLEVELAND, OH","name":"Cleveland State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2c4f8206-f7b9-47f2-a930-da7d20a1aa9a","gradSchool":"1c678295-efa1-4454-b997-5ff0f323f4eb","metroArea":"abd7b42e-3fe4-4969-a9bb-3530a7fe775e","neighborhood":"b28820d6-0ad6-4023-b697-1a88c8e140ee","state":"e22ca9b6-60b3-461e-b905-42a3e83cbeb2","town":"ae4413e9-cc9f-4257-9459-989d096476f0","zipCode":"a90f3fd3-1073-4865-b718-dbc0fa73e805"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Cleveland State","tagline":["4 Year","CLEVELAND, OH"],"type":"College","url":"cleveland-state-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9444657219456147},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":15719},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"880-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a freshman, Cleveland State University has been way better than I expected. Most of the professors are really cool people and like to teach life lessons beyond the course content. The housing is apartment style and is fairly new, even for freshman. Also, the location of campus is second to none, as you are right in downtown Cleveland. There is so much to do including going to sporting events like the Guardians, Cavaliers, Browns, Monsters, and the Men's and Women's basketball teams at CSU. CSU also neighbors Playhouse Square, the second largest theatre district in the country! One concern about CSU many people have is the cold weather, however CSU has a very underrated feature called the InnerLink. Once you get in one building, it is connected to almost all the others via skybridges. Finally, I have never felt unsafe on campus. It has its rough areas on the perimeter of the University, but if you are on-campus, so have nothing to worry about! I cannot recommend CSU enough!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-07T16:53:11.279638Z","guid":"bde94e76-b1a9-4969-9193-658f4e51c9bf","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6bdeb9f589b44e2938bf9a55ede528db0d6c4116","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/66350c2a0b2cb8d33f57cfb8ad69501c778ec6a6","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8d58b8d12add987b6bd5656f0fb101abca380ea1","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9ab54a8724a8edde04fc2b986be873ac231bd8c5"},"guid":"f2045e54-5f7a-454f-bc29-3783968ead12","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-23T20:19:20.523858Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfb3811b672b9abcecf8bf93b261ffbb00fd331d"},"guid":"69e28ba5-8bfd-4c6e-a332-b2c6d3c25d33","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:24:30.368285Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.673052,41.502918,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.673052,41.502918,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"aa144881-5cf0-4f01-917a-7432ee73657d","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/211dcb9c24dac0c2e72c9399df2b7ec1689e8126","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7dda5915797d51e3964456f942066b788a4fa89a"},"guid":"dd3112b9-683b-4782-980a-81d6e592c90d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-07T20:19:42.242597Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6700779727095516,"count":2052},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://clevelandstate.university-tour.com/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cleveland-state-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=cleveland-state-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://clevelandstate.university-tour.com/"}]},{"guid":"1a8e0263-831e-4f18-afef-7770fb6f0fbe","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":661,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.15867,"lon":-76.988492},"entity":{"abbreviation":"MU","alternates":{"ceeb":"2411","ipeds":"213996"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"1a8e0263-831e-4f18-afef-7770fb6f0fbe","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"MECHANICSBURG, PA","name":"Messiah University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"b02a47e0-9663-4337-ad65-2bcab9b51265","gradSchool":"06d1ca41-dbdd-43e1-9a67-5313fbe1c5af","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"6df264e0-a828-44c2-ae46-09f09f4c7763","zipCode":"930f945b-da1c-4431-9dc3-66f2076acf4c"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Messiah","tagline":["4 Year","MECHANICSBURG, PA"],"type":"College","url":"messiah-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7940935192780968},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24120},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1090-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"\"I have had the best experience I could have asked for.

I have realized that in order to stay grounded anywhere, you need to set a strong foundation for yourself, and for me, that foundation is God.\"","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-08T02:43:42.522514Z","guid":"2aa16aab-5f21-4917-9f48-51520257979f","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/830b9968227fcd1bf470f34356b3255ca39305e4","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aff8c4857c0c1d90a5dc60dabaef751b29e21616","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e5f1efef3533a0eb8e4809755e1987be47465074","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4b139481a0e716241026eb83c964767313af2f6d"},"guid":"03e69603-dd1a-4a92-8970-f559037770a5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-26T19:50:25.465433Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0d3fa157856ed90cf1a85470382b98bd9f9fca7"},"guid":"8c18c970-be0f-4022-9a9e-c938361110ea","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-07T15:54:01.233369Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.988492,40.15867,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.988492,40.15867,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"8d779a64-e313-4c1f-b9df-b0dd075104fb","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2ef20ac910d2b1187e77db12cc56fbfb4b61644","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/835ef68f0b09a0c2f1689fb745030d90f74b0415"},"guid":"14bef860-ccf9-463c-9291-897902f79c7f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-07-02T14:53:20.173025Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6611570247933884,"count":1331},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://tour.messiah.edu/?utm_source=niche&utm_medium=online&utm_campaign=profile"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/messiah-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=messiah-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://tour.messiah.edu/?utm_source=niche&utm_medium=online&utm_campaign=profile"}]},{"guid":"f4252d3d-227b-421c-8ee3-b8bfccecf82f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":662,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.076848,"lon":-87.880488},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UW Milwaukee","alternates":{"ceeb":"1473","ipeds":"240453"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"f4252d3d-227b-421c-8ee3-b8bfccecf82f","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"MILWAUKEE, WI","name":"University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee","parentGUIDs":{"college":"234e8e67-b92f-443a-bcf4-43e2d55517dd","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"8b295479-c31f-47a9-83b8-94b2100e2832","gradSchool":"bfdf40f0-80fc-4480-b137-90e6798e1a9d","metroArea":"3940b781-a9f6-4333-b607-6a6367e6af44","neighborhood":"c4332484-7452-42fb-b824-3cdf14b5a609","onlineChild":"98fdafd7-b381-4d81-9beb-9be6e1c31ac0","parent":"234e8e67-b92f-443a-bcf4-43e2d55517dd","state":"963a1085-efe7-45f5-81ee-d2bbf82a907c","town":"54947c4e-5a01-41c7-b49e-6a99a2fefdc5","zipCode":"542c1289-ad69-4fc3-afab-bf91c1a6110e"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Wisconsin - Milwaukee","tagline":["4 Year","MILWAUKEE, WI"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-wisconsin-milwaukee","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8631616425350107},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":16551},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Personally, I have had a great experience here so far. I am local to the campus and find the area to be very welcoming and safe. It is so easy to get involved with different clubs and activities, as I always hear and see about different things happening on campus. The professors are very accommodating which has been super nice as a freshman it gives me a sense of relief making the college experience more positive. I would say the only thing I would like to see change is having more academic services available to the students for help on homework or studying for tests. Although there are some opportunities for this, I think more students would benefit from it if it was offered more.

This role helped me develop leadership and communication skills that will undoubtedly benefit me in my future career in politics and government.\n\nThe campus environment is welcoming, and there’s a genuine effort from staff and faculty to support students.

The school is small and the atmosphere is small and homely but if you looked into it, you'd know that. There isn't much of a party scene, but there are some. The classes and teachers are good and flexible. I'm a CS major here, would I have gone to a bigger college for a \"better\" CS program? Probably, but I like the small atmosphere, calmer school culture, and beautiful campus. Suppose you're looking into a good, small class sizes, liberal arts college. Montevallo is a good choice! However, if you want to do engineering, or don't like how small the college is then your safe bet is AU or another bigger school. Montevallo is a suitcase school so not too much happens in campus over the weekend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-12T20:50:18.041855Z","guid":"6a265a5a-cb23-44b5-ab9e-58ae5686749d","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d2d24c76a72730c0e6b037285ff3af8b9bdcb231.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/65796a67d9f0191f63fd3a25f17f509003b4682e.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d2d24c76a72730c0e6b037285ff3af8b9bdcb231.jpg"},"guid":"e43c15fe-bb94-4ae9-8505-7bd92b56d5d4","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.865099,33.10625,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.865099,33.10625,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5be2b3ca-9554-4274-ac78-5331c7ae21f2","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6876606683804627,"count":778},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://montevallo.edu/tours"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-montevallo/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-montevallo"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://montevallo.edu/tours"}]},{"guid":"03fe5f00-c275-4ce9-96b9-70dae13c88c9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":670,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":43.095183,"lon":-75.272407},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Utica","alternates":{"ceeb":"2932","ipeds":"197045"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"03fe5f00-c275-4ce9-96b9-70dae13c88c9","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"UTICA, NY","name":"Utica University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d55a0ff0-d5b0-4647-b342-7abe6851f35e","gradSchool":"164a5b08-5952-4a6f-a9be-223dda8f75d6","onlineChild":"3b4326f8-ef22-4779-b5ac-a9f850c4cd97","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"513e7067-7d77-4b9d-89b2-5476d2ce8bc4","zipCode":"55c0da5d-9ae9-4d88-99e4-1fd73eedc38d"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Utica","tagline":["4 Year","UTICA, NY"],"type":"College","url":"utica-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.810232004759072},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":22372},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"970-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"When I went on a visit it was very fun and interesting, I love the school structure and how it looks.

Additionally, I think expanding resources for international students, especially in terms of career services and internships, would be beneficial.\n\nOverall, Ensign College has provided me with a solid education and a supportive environment, and I would recommend it to other students looking for a focused and friendly college experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-18T03:26:20.052612Z","guid":"ba18de97-c490-4c90-aa73-ac703c6287df","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8558101d81acca65b080c63d90068189894ca21d","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c01fcf050e0d81fca5a1a808e06976abe2ee916c","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db39a2abf16e0d86be73faa4483c7ab79ff5416f","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e242414c70c85b0ecff57c6266281e58ba609bfe"},"guid":"e90ca182-e578-4e32-acc7-d825df27901d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-23T17:04:16.928001Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.900382,40.771022,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.900382,40.771022,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"dd7e8418-6e11-4410-a76a-c3470b9d3896","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.209497206703911,"count":358},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ensign-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=ensign-college"}]},{"guid":"5c9ab696-de0e-4271-8bf4-163137359704","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":672,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.935743,"lon":-123.030727},"entity":{"abbreviation":"WU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4954","ipeds":"210401"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"5c9ab696-de0e-4271-8bf4-163137359704","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"SALEM, OR","name":"Willamette University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"8c5d1777-7ee4-4bf7-9c4c-8d6931209fd2","gradSchool":"2dcf350c-3126-4ebd-9509-3c772a606af7","metroArea":"51f0b1ca-a5ff-4159-b545-be15c330055c","state":"bb5bef7b-e5b0-48bd-bb7f-ea89dc2109e9","town":"2bcf318e-775b-4139-97b4-9b17457f8ba3","zipCode":"d7e53170-1446-4a9c-a8d2-52d0235c7e81"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Willamette","tagline":["4 Year","SALEM, OR"],"type":"College","url":"willamette-university","variation":5},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8059589384076115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":32957},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1100-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Pros: awesome classes and professors.

However, there are certain areas where more improvement is required – better parking space minus old residence hall updates, and campus events with inconsistent communication as well as failures to identify deadlines exactly.

You’ll love it there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-17T22:27:43.548969Z","guid":"9420ee53-d9aa-4399-ac0c-db39b51f1483","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c9bd4bf0f14c2c8810342c96197cd03881af4f03","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb6cdc67b4822778bbf3fb908736cf8058d1091a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f85855a7310836291a5edf5c9f928c002e207ce7","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8b3b2af684aab880035a517639cbdf982aaf0416"},"guid":"bdb31a3a-bed2-4d65-bbd3-2470ea9dcf20","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ed088ef3f3ebdd14b6d1cf4471c753b1efefaaae"},"guid":"b927847d-2fd5-47c9-9931-395862184e06","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.784728,43.815384,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.784728,43.815384,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"bb22f9a1-72d6-4d3e-8a3c-19b063681339","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/401c029b70e383322be18f04cb0d5661de95ca3f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4e0aa5c0a6eabe39ae1db4990d07e740e7a6cf56"},"guid":"f2110d44-fa32-4841-9db3-dcc1340fbf9c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.969901629716635,"count":6811},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.byui.edu/campus-tours/general-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/brigham-young-university-idaho/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=brigham-young-university-idaho"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.byui.edu/campus-tours/general-tour"}]},{"guid":"58f2596e-aa12-4b16-88b2-0c1569f678ae","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":681,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.665746,"lon":-86.222958},"entity":{"abbreviation":"IUSB","alternates":{"ceeb":"1280","ipeds":"151342"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"58f2596e-aa12-4b16-88b2-0c1569f678ae","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"SOUTH BEND, IN","name":"Indiana University - South Bend","parentGUIDs":{"college":"8b4975fe-d2cb-42fb-a8ed-0cca388f666c","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"a8b195d6-7904-42fc-a413-ef3192fe1025","gradSchool":"bc8565a2-4fc2-47cd-99a4-f17d2d807684","metroArea":"da0be3e0-ed23-4975-8d17-8408d1cf2ac8","parent":"8b4975fe-d2cb-42fb-a8ed-0cca388f666c","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"fd74710b-e679-405b-b389-af4398b9e270","zipCode":"b7691a1d-6aad-408a-af7d-4ed9ebe8fd45"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"IUSB","tagline":["4 Year","SOUTH BEND, IN"],"type":"College","url":"indiana-university-south-bend","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.868824531516184},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":8785},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"970-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love the smaller class sizes at my university because I feel the value of my education is better.

Something I would like to see change is the grading for some of the course.

I had to adjust to being a city girl, to being comfortable in a city where there was a lot less things to do. With that being said, a lot of the fun on campus and off campus was generated by the student-athletes which was about ninety percent of the universities demography. I played Women's Volleyball for Western New Mexico University with a partial scholarship, being one of the top athletes in the league. My experience at Western New Mexico University has been a unique experience and wouldn't change it for the world. One reason, I made a lot of very strong connections with not only my team, but with other student athletes, my coaches, professors, academic advisors, RA's, classmates, athletic trainers, and with local business owners. I also appreciated the stunning landscapes and the natural beauty of being in New Mexico. WNMU although a small university, it will be the memories that will last a lifetime.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-09-06T15:57:02.766794Z","guid":"7a8b97ea-535e-4e1c-89c5-1c9e9513da6a","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-108.284768,32.776962,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-108.284768,32.776962,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"7c1efdd7-85d5-465d-8479-c8d364266bf6","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.632911392405063,"count":316},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-new-mexico-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=western-new-mexico-university"}]},{"guid":"4755f8e4-ceeb-4aa3-a493-893bc7e3dd79","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":686,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":30.363418,"lon":-103.65007},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SRSU","alternates":{"ceeb":"6685","ipeds":"228501"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"4755f8e4-ceeb-4aa3-a493-893bc7e3dd79","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"ALPINE, TX","name":"Sul Ross State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2f5eabde-85b7-425e-839d-580f150ed8f3","gradSchool":"4c7ccff5-df38-4ab8-bace-dcaf0300c45e","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"7c28e2b4-1750-440f-8967-b5ee7b70b09b","zipCode":"bc6a9f7f-9a22-4f6a-8dc0-7e75d5dd8a99"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Sul Ross State","tagline":["4 Year","ALPINE, TX"],"type":"College","url":"sul-ross-state-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9707112970711297},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13130},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"850-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Throughout my first semester of attending Sul Ross I find very peaceful to be a student here.

While it still has general issues; obvious separation of sports students, issues with allergy inclusivity, poor public bathrooms, etc. It's still an amazing school that has been wonderful for a first year at college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-12T22:12:27.176607Z","guid":"c11f0773-5c56-4154-8b46-8796fa689fbe","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/628977843b8ddc5089c8ed79064dcf3601e285d6","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/109be1d11ef726a2c51c4629b77d7e30daf847c0","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/acda218d80143fd4908361766b12c8fecb602a8a","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3073f5ab0fb11c8a61dba226066d43a563016ebb"},"guid":"edca2eab-b83b-4b54-bc1c-694659d23653","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-23T19:21:54.476887Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ded5ffce31bb9ab2b4b64fe3d0025d8b281a9b1"},"guid":"3ca0ac8e-fae6-4d5b-914a-3d2a47e08d8b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-10-27T17:34:09.211689Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-113.98294,46.861074,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-113.98294,46.861074,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"cbfd3388-8b17-47bd-9ed6-83e2464c0070","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c566bd50c290fc42855eaeaf353b4e6819e67218","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7dd376946022ab600dff511c97929b10efde86bf"},"guid":"ebba4aa2-4460-42f5-a399-edb6309199a7","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-19T22:27:41.661217Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.590438639724002,"count":2029},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/umt"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-montana/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-montana"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/umt"}]},{"guid":"76c44eee-eff5-47d9-bc62-686869e11378","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":691,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.439851,"lon":-79.963927},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Carlow","alternates":{"ceeb":"2421","ipeds":"211431"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"76c44eee-eff5-47d9-bc62-686869e11378","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"PITTSBURGH, PA","name":"Carlow University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"eebe21fb-3bc4-44a1-8c96-a465d0442acb","gradSchool":"8b34d7dd-a521-4a61-918f-95e2087cfb49","metroArea":"15cc22ec-ecaf-411f-ac7a-8665d6adeb3a","neighborhood":"39cde534-9546-446e-a3f8-15aa2cb2bab3","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"56f000ed-ce4a-4636-a0bf-4fe70e652684","zipCode":"b720bee5-79e0-42bb-af9a-7127637a5f28"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Carlow","tagline":["4 Year","PITTSBURGH, PA"],"type":"College","url":"carlow-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9270462633451957},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17437},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"850-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have had the pleasure of attending Carlow for about 2 years now.

The football games (though D3) are always exciting and there are endless opportunities to get involved!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-24T03:52:02.72199Z","guid":"c06c3145-bed1-4aea-933c-ee645d2a7827","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/377333c08fe7891f2723cf399dd03a2977a17962.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b205393e1ddcb9e045bd0682a63f3ff4b421836.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/377333c08fe7891f2723cf399dd03a2977a17962.jpg"},"guid":"259954a0-bcd1-450c-9aaf-80fecfb1da9b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"1ec00a89-c104-4b0e-8857-ae84b6ca36cf","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.683569979716024,"count":1479},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin-whitewater/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-wisconsin-whitewater"}]},{"guid":"282c1e12-97c3-483f-bcda-4bb6f9371ce7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":695,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":37.7141207,"lon":-89.2173736},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SIU","alternates":{"ceeb":"1726","ipeds":"149222"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"282c1e12-97c3-483f-bcda-4bb6f9371ce7","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"CARBONDALE, IL","name":"Southern Illinois University Carbondale","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"d6c317c1-3b66-41ac-9a00-8b36cc5d0e87","gradSchool":"091968b3-3c15-4205-959f-496e7281fc98","onlineChild":"177c7d1d-c3d4-4371-848c-85f5196fd6a6","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"b87e1e47-669c-40e9-a379-18732e465145","zipCode":"e242a17d-90f2-44f9-a444-8e8f455cf50e"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Southern Illinois Carbondale","tagline":["4 Year","CARBONDALE, IL"],"type":"College","url":"southern-illinois-university-carbondale","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9150788772792461},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":16990},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"900-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Other","body":"I had great hands on learning experiences with the courses I took.

The Political Science department here is probably one of the best in the state, and the professors are phenomenal. There are a few negatives to the university, primarily the lack of food options on campus, and occasional incompetent professors and counselors. Don't expect to party here unless you and your friends are throwing a small and private party. The building and general infrastructure is a bit outdated, which can occasionally create horror stories about the facilities (a dorm's roof collapsed and flooded the room after a heavy thunderstorm).  Another great thing about this school is that it has a size of about 5,000 students, and is perfect for allowing more introverted students to open up as well as develop deeper connections and relations with your professors, administrators, and fellow students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-13T18:37:57.545742Z","guid":"191100f9-6c6e-4007-9209-88717cf4f8ad","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6fbaf323883e56df0dc5e0e1cddaa947f16ee420","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/36e69801aa1b359f7d0b1ff32429ce881d3670ea","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/61248e9147c9a3b25fceb5928e673a9efd196ab7","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ef53d40e3a6308bedc6f838dacb45c729024389"},"guid":"c92fa006-c8c4-4172-8544-67a0d25b75fc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-27T21:44:51.180805Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92756cecf61363ee49d9f1f40b41133ab6949a3a"},"guid":"5cfd1f3a-4cb3-42c2-b44d-2283299ad6df","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-27T22:16:52.188305Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.028667,34.938506,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.028667,34.938506,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5710b970-c4be-4ef9-aebc-0a42fc006dd5","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/588d7fed60230527450dab889ac317717e9850ca","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/088919bb6808c718fe2f1ad888c7470788374215"},"guid":"a350d175-af5a-46d7-b777-2cb2fa8f9ad1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-08-08T19:29:04.0436Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.746697300402068,"count":1741},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.winthrop.edu/#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/winthrop-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=winthrop-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.winthrop.edu/#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"d1aee02b-e2b9-4592-b7d6-c2f75f2c1945","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":697,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.84266,"lon":-71.466915},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Rhode Island","alternates":{"ceeb":"3724","ipeds":"217420"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d1aee02b-e2b9-4592-b7d6-c2f75f2c1945","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"PROVIDENCE, RI","name":"Rhode Island College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c39ba72c-9167-458a-b313-8214603fab2a","gradSchool":"be1e237d-a720-4d50-84be-7e3665a88e18","metroArea":"260eca0f-67e4-4247-a1e8-89d297c15747","state":"b90321a2-492c-48a7-a36e-86fd6e8e3254","town":"9c35e130-cf48-4133-a9e8-59d7d577b21f","zipCode":"2511a7df-d560-4242-be35-cd510ac4236d"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Rhode Island College","tagline":["4 Year","PROVIDENCE, RI"],"type":"College","url":"rhode-island-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.875223271242664},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":11014},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"870-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I value the close-knit and welcoming community at Rhode Island College, where it's easy to connect with professors and peers.

You have to be more in clubs to get a campus life or sports, but otherwise there is really not.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T22:19:35.898711Z","guid":"a00a3f78-7972-4953-8e56-7a273d2ad2ec","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dc65b4a9b700e96d7403319dfb63605459879d5c","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d9304a017b585c23972c9350ca5bbccbe7cba29","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8c5e698004f94e9e6431c9f1c2633157058adbc7","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eb4d50232ca0f6f76e77be2a53cb307390632ffa"},"guid":"c6500b97-8e80-4187-addd-93ed4a9dffbd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-13T18:19:12.829109Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9cbb5bdeecafa736417ef8595f1e3de2bf865157"},"guid":"cb4a2f03-fffd-4a63-82b7-4a1ac75adb04","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-05T22:46:58.523625Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"999688df-0021-4c20-8c1b-0f851e07feb4","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d4ea5277751414ba09404b07e757bf04181f9974","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ec1b1571792f86359eb4562963040bbedd8bd95"},"guid":"4628f5fa-c9aa-49d3-b465-29991e059b0b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-04-10T18:20:39.436919Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5543478260869565,"count":828},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.mnstate.edu/virtual-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=minnesota-state-university-moorhead"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.mnstate.edu/virtual-tour/"}]},{"guid":"4841e1b5-7784-4d48-9ee2-e8411a3c1c23","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":699,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.775304,"lon":-88.143649},"entity":{"abbreviation":"North Central","alternates":{"ceeb":"1555","ipeds":"147660"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"4841e1b5-7784-4d48-9ee2-e8411a3c1c23","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NAPERVILLE, IL","name":"North Central College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"eee987d8-6a90-4a02-b4ab-40c458ea8b5f","gradSchool":"4c6be197-623b-4856-bcac-794564ee793e","metroArea":"b1fe05c5-1876-422b-81a7-8dfa8da9acfd","state":"bfcbe833-91c0-45f9-93bd-afcb90dc592e","town":"c59adb01-c9ba-4890-b9dd-5a8f4ccde0f6","zipCode":"6a4798b6-56c4-4bf7-98dc-9962d6e0549e"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"North Central","tagline":["4 Year","NAPERVILLE, IL"],"type":"College","url":"north-central-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.608746813100608},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":25285},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1020-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"NC transformed my life!

I also realized early on the importance of networking attending career fairs and talking to alumni helped me understand how crucial connections are for future opportunities. The idea that \"your network is your net worth\" became real, and I saw how the people I met, whether professors, alumni, or peers, would shape my path ahead.

Sometimes professors are not available enough, though.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-18T01:10:15.539278Z","guid":"a551afa8-7643-4b52-bc8a-2f940152ef31","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8b927b2c0732063cddac5718142cd63b47dd8749","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/98e61e1022478feaa065a770a001705dc02a11ae","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5c92283d49e03795736e49bd123fef3205715e7c","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e94d187d2d813377151b81b1e93b4efa14ee497d"},"guid":"d2346c0b-632a-4991-ba9e-c4a973e24ca8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-22T18:17:27.756014Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ef2f993afbc91978b397dd714639168cac52d75d"},"guid":"02a92251-70b9-4a78-a9ac-1c80fa4c6b23","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-15T18:44:21.643534Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.484873,48.737236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.484873,48.737236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3c62f04c-f0ea-44a4-8b64-9369b810aa61","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6bb0a8955ddcb5320e17419d194c4a9c389d448f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e02f26e26f6ffa1075374112d3ae7b9c8817b850"},"guid":"986f8cf3-48d7-47b7-ba42-e4e5d1d7a6e3","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-12-02T19:46:41.515041Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7204918032786884,"count":2440},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://admissions.wwu.edu/visit/virtual-tours"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-washington-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=western-washington-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://admissions.wwu.edu/visit/virtual-tours"}]},{"guid":"14ba174e-3938-47f2-97a1-9f4bad429f17","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":702,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.743896,"lon":-90.734378},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Delta State","alternates":{"ceeb":"1163","ipeds":"175616"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"14ba174e-3938-47f2-97a1-9f4bad429f17","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"CLEVELAND, MS","name":"Delta State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"79d0c70e-a399-47ba-8cab-066d4d0b127c","gradSchool":"12180756-0f53-47f5-8a12-85a2cf197c9d","state":"278befb8-d5e0-43d2-bf87-cf6d95e438d2","town":"77ac1d23-5dca-4c8b-80df-7e53c60abe9f","zipCode":"52084330-2485-41e7-9cd5-29e98dda1690"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Delta State","tagline":["4 Year","CLEVELAND, MS"],"type":"College","url":"delta-state-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9861111111111112},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":14138},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"940-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"One of the things I appreciate about DSU is the user-friendly online process.

Additionally, being involved in various initiatives, including tutoring and applying for programs like the UNICEF Youth Foresight Fellow, has allowed me to contribute to the college community and grow my professional skills.\n The diverse and inclusive environment makes it easy to feel connected and supported in both academic and extracurricular activities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-03T08:01:00.339626Z","guid":"6873d706-cd29-4a14-b881-82eb28f21686","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/004f234a6b770f650cfff87df7dd32852d10d7d1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9711e8e4e8ad1070c600a5a0eebb8c998c0b65ec.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/004f234a6b770f650cfff87df7dd32852d10d7d1.jpg"},"guid":"1744aa18-d979-4eee-a040-5dfe66469d6e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b61904832cbf3fc6a2977f6ec64b06c4c8d7b5cb"},"guid":"a1bcfda5-86de-4e07-9f63-135235d0e257","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:03:25.786169Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"118907b9-b472-4568-8ed0-dfb51b9ef158","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7628865979381443,"count":582},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HSX1nHiQJc"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-college-of-st-scholastica/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=the-college-of-st-scholastica"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HSX1nHiQJc"}]},{"guid":"18d9e95a-0033-48b8-93d5-214d3e7cf561","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":706,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":44.973081,"lon":-93.290069},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Dunwoody College","alternates":{"ceeb":"2265","ipeds":"175227"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"18d9e95a-0033-48b8-93d5-214d3e7cf561","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MINNEAPOLIS, MN","name":"Dunwoody College of Technology","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"9911515a-7473-4f32-9ec1-5fa51c80d63f","metroArea":"b9517c86-f92e-4a8e-ac5f-e7530b9c2636","neighborhood":"5615ecf6-cfca-492d-b67a-dd0375585bf5","state":"534cd634-543d-4983-89c3-22323ac74f77","town":"40223063-9cdc-4cc8-bdfe-6ec6f5d889ed","zipCode":"1e0a4722-763e-49b9-bc4c-012341751f74"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Dunwoody College","tagline":["4 Year","MINNEAPOLIS, MN"],"type":"College","url":"dunwoody-college-of-technology","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9804347826086957},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24172},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The community is incredible, and full of non-traditional students who are there to work hard.

Despite being a private school, the campus is located in a neighborhood, so you can see the school's neighbors wandering around the area. One of the pros of the school is the small student-to-teacher ratio. This allows students to communicate and form relationships with professors. Another pro is the evaluations done after each semester. Professor evaluations give feedback on teachers and courses based on student responses. Two cons are the cafeteria food and locations. The cafeteria food is decent, but meals get repetitive. Finally, going out to nice areas without a car is hard because the school is away from restaurants and shops.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-20T05:54:11.357374Z","guid":"f73285c2-4cd3-4abb-8541-7372c9cc30b1","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/440c11b2a4bcc9ff55dfc3997cb637d0972a052b","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/94bd554901cab611391cf6bb26b38aeb2b9a6ab1","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/570713dfac610358400e33b52104326db1cd5c9a","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c4b23f745c18cd918ffeb10b536cf5ff0f78854e"},"guid":"1d00042e-1292-4eb2-b694-3c8a6a529a71","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-04T19:27:56.088336Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b4ba685662e4494ecffa8528c0c6ce72bfa4c500"},"guid":"d55aacf4-4474-4a37-bd20-f1c2bdca38a1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-04T19:31:13.276968Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.514654,37.980014,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.514654,37.980014,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"cb5d107e-8b1d-43d5-b81b-eb597e84b2c9","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6d1fdc823cd87489c3483fbb61c3c5891c0a393b","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50eb80421abde8f3b8bde5219e676bab3bf85977"},"guid":"58ac3029-8d7f-4ebf-9acf-860449ec1852","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-04T21:05:58.172741Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.524532710280374,"count":856},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.dominican.edu/admissions/visit-and-connect"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dominican-university-of-california/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=dominican-university-of-california"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.dominican.edu/admissions/visit-and-connect"}]},{"guid":"86927070-080d-490e-b03e-74cf375edf6a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":710,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.342712,"lon":-71.243738},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Lasell","alternates":{"ceeb":"3481","ipeds":"166391"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"86927070-080d-490e-b03e-74cf375edf6a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEWTON, MA","name":"Lasell University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"30b8db32-3b30-440f-a944-ef23b93121d2","gradSchool":"404ac766-0147-4776-b4ec-53bb741d66a8","metroArea":"1fb5f13a-6673-4bc7-a0c2-fcb7e56d7831","neighborhood":"45575842-9d2d-49c5-b5e2-0eb82ae30c66","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"5f2944d1-5cac-4123-a33c-8d68fc8dbaab","zipCode":"88baee33-5e3c-4810-b757-5bb91a0e8e2e"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Lasell","tagline":["4 Year","NEWTON, MA"],"type":"College","url":"lasell-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7320861277797388},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":29706},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1020-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Lasell opened so many amazing opportunities for me, especially, within my career.

Shepherd University is a college set in the small town of Shepherdstown, WV. The professor are all really nice and honest when it comes to how they grade and their overall teaching styles and a huge plus is that most of the classes only have 30+ people in them so the professor always has time for personal office hours which has greatly helped me. Another thing to mention is that this college is relatively small so you have the opportunity to walk to your classes and do not have to worry about taking the bus even though we do have shuttle bus transportation for those who may need it. Also included in your tuition is a membership to the wellness center which is a great gym with a whole bunch of different equipment for you to work out on like machines, weights, track, and also a swimming pool!

I have really enjoyed the diversity found on campus and surrounding areas, including the city of Liberty. Additionally, smaller class sizes have allowed me to build closer relationships with my peers, professors, and other staff on campus. There is currently a major investment in bringing the athletic and academic sides of the school closer, which can only bring improvement to the school. I am hoping this will connect me better with some of the other organizations on campus like Greek Life and Seminars. Greek life will begin this semester, and I am excited to build new relationships and see a new side of the school.  One experience I have found less appealing is my dorm, but I also understand that the freshman dorm life is something that each student, regardless of school, experiences. Overall, I would rate William Jewell very highly!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-13T17:19:33.94127Z","guid":"31dec2bc-443c-420f-9441-cdee6068c544","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6f7c3c173475f98d448ce89748ccf73d617d52a1","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8978f55ab73d0b8d3112798b18962ef11b825a88","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6f7c3c173475f98d448ce89748ccf73d617d52a1","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d978cb693ec07d632fb7dd57c5afff67ea6d4782"},"guid":"55cf05ec-8afa-4b27-91a9-c006f12e96d2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.41207,39.247848,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.41207,39.247848,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"120b6ccf-6d4e-4278-a4b6-369995ef4e5e","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.528497409326425,"count":386},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.jewell.edu/virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-jewell-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=william-jewell-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.jewell.edu/virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"62d80fc1-0b18-42d3-a7d9-7ea3593c3a0a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":717,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":30.51358,"lon":-90.468558},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Southeastern Louisiana","alternates":{"ceeb":"6656","ipeds":"160612"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"62d80fc1-0b18-42d3-a7d9-7ea3593c3a0a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"HAMMOND, LA","name":"Southeastern Louisiana University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"07d8fb50-b207-4558-860c-4234b1fdfd2d","gradSchool":"a0ac2634-af9b-44af-8b68-9fefad017d29","state":"0a52f9a9-fad5-4324-8731-e46e1f299b3a","town":"aff4d556-971d-4322-b485-f3d0de4286a3","zipCode":"9ae82b1c-21f2-4f86-8e60-1001c4c99632"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Southeastern Louisiana","tagline":["4 Year","HAMMOND, LA"],"type":"College","url":"southeastern-louisiana-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.989768774299161},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12291},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I absolutely love how the campus is not too big or too small.

I previoulsy attended a top 20 liberal arts college before transferring here after receiving a full academic schorship. The professors at this university are truly unmatched in comparison. The level of care and detail is evident and you really have to work significantly harder. Students care deeply about their classes and aren't just out to party. Classes are often intense but certainly create better job opportunities than any of my friends who are at ivy league/prestigous universities. The equestrian program is also a big part of the campus. I believe I am being given opportunities not to just do what I love but to turn them into a career.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-27T01:42:31.499535Z","guid":"605895ba-ef01-4b69-9d3a-2404bea85528","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a519177b789c4c95c7b5142010454248239883d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a37ed0ac0e2502a7f87201575c5ceaf30cf9bd4a.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a519177b789c4c95c7b5142010454248239883d.jpg"},"guid":"adc15001-b247-47e7-bc2f-7b7d15ae08f9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.788625,42.255866,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.788625,42.255866,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e36ae49e-ed2e-4e90-9875-8f8d3e3754bd","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4041867954911433,"count":621},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://alfred.university-tour.com/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/alfred-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=alfred-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://alfred.university-tour.com/"}]},{"guid":"b56c4a6b-1db7-44fb-805a-30f3b3b61862","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":725,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.38214,"lon":-118.517422},"entity":{"abbreviation":"The Master's University","alternates":{"ceeb":"4411","ipeds":"117751"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b56c4a6b-1db7-44fb-805a-30f3b3b61862","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"SANTA CLARITA, CA","name":"The Master's University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","gradSchool":"c22d0ef2-c77c-4d6d-a6ac-48e5751c2c44","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"a203d21e-0e84-42bf-8b60-bd496058805c","zipCode":"c37ba442-91ac-460c-9c23-c4216f37a127"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"The Master's University","tagline":["4 Year","SANTA CLARITA, CA"],"type":"College","url":"the-masters-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7818396226415094},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":30783},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"990-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"This university is an incredible experience for young Christians who desire to receive an education that is both practical and edifying.

Overall, everything is fine but would weigh my options for graduate school at a different location.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-22T03:22:19.778341Z","guid":"c4d2b8bd-4a07-4b06-bc42-47636628e167","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f54691f2f4f00786a3baa3fbf15cc94243dbaa81","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0e29af633eb66ad87c7d1edff800d79a90d61c5a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/79c7b2c62df66c7b1b67fc3db105de7a59393a16","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d32286aa8f13df257a156d7fdeef294d96993e47"},"guid":"dec9f469-71de-4437-a558-9d19d47bd3e8","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-12T20:51:56.031087Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a511dc5a67e351b7ef55dd342d22af4b91e22c5e"},"guid":"40e95661-5f98-4467-a30e-80d466bedd51","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-13T14:52:20.381628Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f000d070-ecaf-4392-9230-d131f0a62b85","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aaea480f2a12c88049fc87c3c71cc5f6204669c4","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/648581d6e629ab757106c57f08405e37b77ae499"},"guid":"4e27e9c4-5f2d-47d4-a562-c03acc9a63be","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-02-08T17:17:01.548785Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6661742983751844,"count":4739},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://odu.university-tour.com/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/old-dominion-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=old-dominion-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://odu.university-tour.com/"}]},{"guid":"bfba009e-0ba4-4107-833e-baed8c564b1d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":729,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.588173,"lon":-70.819133},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Gordon","alternates":{"ipeds":"165936"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"bfba009e-0ba4-4107-833e-baed8c564b1d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WENHAM, MA","name":"Gordon College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"73408ede-8abc-4153-a30f-d0ab40cd5bda","gradSchool":"09fc312f-5b97-4add-8700-aa173f531005","metroArea":"1fb5f13a-6673-4bc7-a0c2-fcb7e56d7831","state":"e08f5e71-b74a-4e28-ac28-8b4569dd5eef","town":"d8447636-ecdd-4a8a-9f3c-8d6054851a5d","zipCode":"0738a4fb-ae0c-4528-9c90-266ba62d9682"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Gordon","tagline":["4 Year","WENHAM, MA"],"type":"College","url":"gordon-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9175627240143369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":24483},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1020-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Gordon College has been a fulfilling experience for me.

Teachers don't peddle doctrine, but they are solidly Christian and believe wholeheartedly in the cosmic conflict of good vs evil. To be a well-adjusted person in the world, it is important to have a solid grasp on understanding good vs evil. The academics were always good, and friendly discussion was always top priority. The teachers are excellent, and they want to see you succeed. The only problems (since I was primarily an online student) was that there were sometimes issues with tech. Like, every other school that uses online learning platforms, Jessup was no different. There was a fair deal of tech issues. Starting this year, they're moving away from Moodle and going to Canvas. I've used both platforms and I think it was Moodle that was responsible for so many tech issues. I'm hoping that this year they'll see much fewer tech issues.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-10-25T16:56:43.248376Z","guid":"4044d108-63e0-40d9-9c49-e1ffcfa5a2e0","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c8763ac9347dc93496018e7c459e2605aa901d32","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/464d026a4db79854286203e19ee7a537fc222a36","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c5afbc05cb110118ae802923d5c4155d2bbd4c9b","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2b6aab49ffd2a915cb1726ce13e39e45701fa1ec"},"guid":"28f7e349-f771-4616-8b1d-fc8ed8af15c6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-09-18T21:46:19.093251Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a965cc64586f4a206de5318dce472343896bc2eb"},"guid":"add51256-1e63-48c7-a565-79be8062be3c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-10-06T17:51:58.197008Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.292312,38.819728,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.292312,38.819728,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"f138e6e7-1a18-4ff7-bbed-4944ef7f4e29","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f287f55db00d66362e48413409bcc0cb7b682ef2","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/94fa7870cb1db76c2a3d28b79db1abf7a996df48"},"guid":"7104bfb6-54da-4832-bfb2-cbf5013da6c6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-08-18T21:25:57.342378Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.008992805755396,"count":556},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://visitour.io/jessup-university/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/jessup-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=jessup-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://visitour.io/jessup-university/"}]},{"guid":"edbb65ad-28c6-4c76-99c5-2a6ca129c8bc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":732,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":46.578983,"lon":-90.874991},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Northland","alternates":{"ceeb":"1561","ipeds":"239512"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"edbb65ad-28c6-4c76-99c5-2a6ca129c8bc","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"ASHLAND, WI","name":"Northland College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"c1f95b44-d973-4f8e-8fea-147f71bf5406","state":"963a1085-efe7-45f5-81ee-d2bbf82a907c","town":"dd3aefb5-1238-4a30-8caa-378fb052c889","zipCode":"31a799c2-e7af-47ee-bf02-32476e5f29d8"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Northland","tagline":["4 Year","ASHLAND, WI"],"type":"College","url":"northland-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6838905775075987},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":23252},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1010-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Northland College was a beautiful place to be young, try new things, and make mistakes in a safe environment.

I think that would help the college and the student body sense of camaraderie and togetherness. It would also involve the greater community in a more direct way, which is a thing that many colleges could be better about.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-03-30T18:05:20.620066Z","guid":"a9bb5a6b-cdb7-42cd-99bf-461e20b0ef1b","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a07ba57a60260aa9f152a1fbf708beda70b3a2c2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2210458c3f281ba3e6ba2701a53aa139ed5d04ba.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a07ba57a60260aa9f152a1fbf708beda70b3a2c2.jpg"},"guid":"7f162409-1929-4dda-8d0d-83cef21b4737","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.874991,46.578983,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.874991,46.578983,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"2e9a1002-1597-42ff-98d6-c34ae7d14e30","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8280701754385964,"count":285},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://vimeo.com/705456637/b12e0dbb05"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northland-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=northland-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://vimeo.com/705456637/b12e0dbb05"}]},{"guid":"7972bd5b-de66-4e43-ae2d-4eb1c7eb75ba","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":733,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":35.477785,"lon":-93.467924},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Ozarks","alternates":{"ceeb":"6111","ipeds":"107558"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7972bd5b-de66-4e43-ae2d-4eb1c7eb75ba","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"CLARKSVILLE, AR","name":"University of the Ozarks","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"edd90dcc-6a09-4295-8e30-fe8a7a98442f","state":"573f6157-5e4f-44b4-b3ef-c61126aaa2a8","town":"75549b1d-0ef5-48b4-a8e1-cde96207dbda","zipCode":"0d32f1d2-d446-4709-bb37-037645ad5570"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Ozarks","tagline":["4 Year","CLARKSVILLE, AR"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-the-ozarks","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6018604651162791},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":16319},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My experience was not one that was a very good one.

I would love to see more diverse course offerings, particularly in specialized subjects that aren’t currently available. Additionally, expanding the facilities, especially for student gatherings and events, would enhance the campus experience. Overall, though, I feel that LCU provides a solid foundation for personal and academic growth!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-03T03:30:11.427045Z","guid":"fcf86680-50b4-4632-9f13-4e464ebea529","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d97bb0cd262afed92100e0964b70de74e6025064","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f53958015170e62be524a3dc37b2673a958c236a","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5659fc5d5cb7a374e31ff729017329304e9f67f8","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/46c5bb584b7463967b3dfa6cf4eb8eab53c7ca63"},"guid":"eca17326-6b4f-494b-909d-fbe6a6dc9f2e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-07-26T18:38:42.609536Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.4267,31.3253,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.4267,31.3253,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5b528be7-40d7-446e-b29c-769802a5d5cc","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.426332288401254,"count":319},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/louisiana-christian-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=louisiana-christian-university"}]},{"guid":"17bc125d-a7ab-4df1-a556-e0e15ba2fdd1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":737,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.648068,"lon":-80.146922},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Allegheny","alternates":{"ceeb":"2006","ipeds":"210669"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"17bc125d-a7ab-4df1-a556-e0e15ba2fdd1","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"MEADVILLE, PA","name":"Allegheny College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"83357330-3e1b-4f41-b310-bbf273f48e87","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"020794f4-6d1e-425b-b9b0-506e56f331d0","zipCode":"1e740447-2308-4bdb-b665-f599a979fa18"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Allegheny","tagline":["4 Year","MEADVILLE, PA"],"type":"College","url":"allegheny-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.6971525096525096},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":26719},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have had the best experience at Allegheny!

The other colleges just can't compare to the excellence of the USF educational department.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-22T23:34:45.590442Z","guid":"09d4c73f-4950-40c0-b80c-533ce45158ee","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3e3d2567b11afeb415eee5434b022da1db0e51c8","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/55a0c9ebeab2983acf9b21f0605bffc9a0d4bb41","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b34b2217a6ced5bde892006d2492109d436eb886","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/731545b108b4446636fabca6f1c830d3bb0a170d"},"guid":"b275a255-574e-45f2-899e-8b4aa3d73f95","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-04T12:45:33.012626Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d94445cd042f9df0775b67f877efb975831ea8de"},"guid":"7f4d675c-e359-45f0-8b52-2a40ef17d6bc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-04-11T13:53:48.571095Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.173694,41.087772,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.173694,41.087772,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"5c7d978f-3651-4f9e-b75c-ce614483e619","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/792b482ab84543e9cf113449c92da0b52f2f252d","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dfa3dd0fd0fa7b4ee742a0f4793ea0f9b4dc0a18"},"guid":"7964f957-a96a-4d6a-82be-9b4fef105627","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-26T13:11:24.560115Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.923791821561338,"count":538},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.sf.edu/tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-saint-francis-indiana/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-saint-francis-indiana"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.sf.edu/tour/"}]},{"guid":"25744055-bf58-4a30-91b3-07c2a15b4f29","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":741,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":34.066927,"lon":-118.168965},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Cal State Los Angeles","alternates":{"ceeb":"4399","ipeds":"110592"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"25744055-bf58-4a30-91b3-07c2a15b4f29","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"LOS ANGELES, CA","name":"California State University - Los Angeles","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","gradSchool":"2098d2bf-f58d-42f4-9186-37fae26cf9f7","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","neighborhood":"fde3ce17-a1fc-42d1-beb3-d3cc729fd430","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"17b8a4a7-f8e8-4c00-8f57-1c87023a02a5","zipCode":"46b8321e-1cfc-4b36-b419-6a374091f82c"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Cal State Los Angeles","tagline":["4 Year","LOS ANGELES, CA"],"type":"College","url":"california-state-university-los-angeles","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8694127699696514},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":5801},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) is a solid institution for those prioritizing education, but it may not be the ideal choice for social butterflies or those seeking a bustling campus life. As a commuter school, Cal State LA attracts a large number of students who come and go, often making it feel more like a place to get work done rather than a social hub. It's a smaller campus where many students tend to know each other, but the opportunities for vibrant parties and social events are limited. While the amenities offered by the school are decent, the overall experience is highly dependent on the individual's initiative—what you get out of it is largely what you put into it. For students looking for a robust social scene, this may not be the best fit, but for those focused on academics, it provides a reliable and functional environment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-28T04:33:08.786601Z","guid":"1f19da94-7e42-41bc-8560-82668d73e4f5","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.168965,34.066927,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.168965,34.066927,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"ee0f1dd8-1aa3-4186-bcda-327b73c1ea26","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.649652672908487,"count":3311},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university-los-angeles/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-state-university-los-angeles"}]},{"guid":"d5224815-08cc-45aa-b0a0-e92a254980ee","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":742,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.171898,"lon":-80.240388},"directAdmissions":{"isLive":true},"entity":{"abbreviation":"W&J","alternates":{"ceeb":"2967","ipeds":"216667"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d5224815-08cc-45aa-b0a0-e92a254980ee","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WASHINGTON, PA","name":"Washington & Jefferson College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"552c8038-ece7-4429-ab19-2991d455ca65","gradSchool":"29da276f-5dd4-4028-9078-fd14bbdc85ee","metroArea":"15cc22ec-ecaf-411f-ac7a-8665d6adeb3a","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"96c13d41-e6a6-4fb8-9de1-98346d2ec428","zipCode":"3b6607ef-fbf2-41f9-8642-b76c31563a1e"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Washington & Jefferson","tagline":["4 Year","WASHINGTON, PA"],"type":"College","url":"washington-and-jefferson-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8807850029291154},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":25636},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1010-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I’m still fairly new to the school, so I don’t really know many people.

Drama and conflict does happen to go on in the dormitory between floors/ rooms and I do believe there’s different approaches that the school could take instead of just kicking people out of dorms and moving them. Other than a few inconveniences, W&J is a great place to be. I have came across so many major life changing opportunities and have learned so much in a short amount of time. The professors are very willing to be a helping hand or mentor, and so far I have been treated with nothing but kindness every time I reach out to them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-14T01:08:08.45004Z","guid":"f5e7d310-6e80-4126-a5a5-0dd6a144f21e","helpfulness":2,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/44ecdcbd830491750c74c1a73cadd1b473a7737a","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dea3351d10bf3df9acfdfeaca0560784ffce2574","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/091734a5b001b05202d79370edf7727701ceed50","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/69e42c1d7a7af38ddb89cc0308c42a1dd7cb7ebc"},"guid":"d6893e25-5d85-4f24-8fcb-c4e6a90b2e8b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-01-29T16:21:39.585287Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b335c146156c4436911735f7ef2b1a3ecfb452d3"},"guid":"d2cc3daa-b143-47d6-a7e5-fcb54c37e43d","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-29T20:24:41.850667Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.240388,40.171898,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.240388,40.171898,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"55b70c9e-6ca4-417e-81f0-cf2a13e00f26","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5f49c35ffafd72ebc959483002e99a0bc3ee80f8","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d3707b4dde3504319ec84db32f840a547f790e8e"},"guid":"fac5c04a-4f88-4f32-adc5-1c32b7e5353e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-08-27T16:47:26.206628Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5578673602080624,"count":769},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/63857/123316"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington-and-jefferson-college/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=washington-and-jefferson-college"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/63857/123316"}]},{"guid":"04b96d74-4243-448d-b842-0c4e6a1dfe97","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":743,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.86524,"lon":-118.259316},"entity":{"abbreviation":"CSU Dominguez Hills","alternates":{"ceeb":"4098","ipeds":"110547"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"04b96d74-4243-448d-b842-0c4e6a1dfe97","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"CARSON, CA","name":"California State University - Dominguez Hills","parentGUIDs":{"college":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"e5bb415c-e0e4-4df0-b3d5-51643b61eec7","gradSchool":"352ac97d-c860-46b4-9df1-d94f1d16092a","metroArea":"ff9270f0-7630-4e8b-bd45-e748c8e3a2b6","parent":"1c6001ce-925d-4697-9099-9df0e934ba69","state":"b56d7c2d-d07e-4aa2-bcf6-925ecb0890f6","town":"fbf6be5a-f2fd-49c2-b4f4-e036d84a480d","zipCode":"f71ca593-237a-4dbc-8ad5-b898a6caf6b8"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Cal State Dominguez Hills","tagline":["4 Year","CARSON, CA"],"type":"College","url":"california-state-university-dominguez-hills","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8913122880250457},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":5068},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I loved the sense of community in college and how diverse the experiences were.

It's like everything in life, there's good with the bad. I enjoyed the professors and Doctors who taught there, talking to them, and getting to know them is the best thing you can do for yourself! These are the people who will write you recommendation letters someday. Get involved in student life, the school had so many activities planned and teams to support. I wasn't the biggest fan of the area, the locals are not welcoming to those who are not white or don't appear white, so keep that in mind. One thing I would like to see change is the vetting process for speakers at Chapel. Obviously, you're going to get some who agree and others who don't agree with your worldview. Still, this one lady came in and took it upon herself to rewrite the history of white people and Native Americans, which wasn't appreciated by someone who is Native American. The place is what you make of it, and the people make the place, it's a stunning campus with kind-hearted people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-02-24T21:37:55.035847Z","guid":"aa36293b-ffd3-406d-a5b8-11223a1334f7","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e48802477fa37a75bc14ff4b543be39eed2a9b94","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/781bd39def9fa901b345d909c05de80a127332dc","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe6c51c6d6ca247e1411758da3c07a94af8f43ba","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dcd1260006130ce6143483169b87abe24489d9b7"},"guid":"248fafc1-0b84-43fd-8ac5-065a9a1ec206","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-03-15T17:05:54.101035Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e7bc6880a34780ef22f2fccc4ba61b3e9d48ef24"},"guid":"574791a5-f1a2-4431-bde8-aee5e41b0cfc","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-09-13T15:07:51.710437Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.156532,36.585899,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.156532,36.585899,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"9dbadf0e-504b-4407-a28c-8cc31c61c03b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3f5a55218050292f36c8856ade679041275713f7","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9d7d1aaacd8f3427ca3d3b043789240570dfc5e5"},"guid":"4a744c81-c442-493d-b8aa-6e044a6f953a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-03T15:13:24.916592Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8671171171171173,"count":444},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/king-university-tennessee/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=king-university-tennessee"}]},{"guid":"7c53d020-3e53-4ea8-b7c1-45be4627d53d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":746,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.283122,"lon":-74.742822},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Rider","alternates":{"ceeb":"2758","ipeds":"186283"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7c53d020-3e53-4ea8-b7c1-45be4627d53d","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"LAWRENCEVILLE, NJ","name":"Rider University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6c9953c4-b55c-49b7-90ae-6ecd61528343","gradSchool":"152e26b5-1efe-44dc-8fea-d9baaa6bfa95","state":"ed4102c4-b16f-4ccd-8d8b-ccfeb8fa21ea","town":"913f2076-dcd5-4825-b72e-e1facccadb29","zipCode":"4d56082c-0857-4503-a35b-cd6519f51135"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Rider","tagline":["4 Year","LAWRENCEVILLE, NJ"],"type":"College","url":"rider-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8413276231263384},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":26388},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1100-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience with Rider University is truly amazing. The professors really try to help their students in anyway they can. Whether that be extra credit assignments, reviews before exams and review study guides to help you prep, as well as even responding to emails in a quick manner. Rider University prioritzes their staff and student safety very much by maintaining a very strict school policy. The staff are very understanding when it comes to the hardships and mental health that students face. They have counseling on campus that is free with your tuition for each and every student to get the help that they need. Every student at Rider Univserity is always heard and valued, creating an environment where students feel supported both academically and personally. The campus is a welcoming place, with various clubs and organizations that cater to diverse interests, helping students find their niche and build lasting friendships.

My professors have been amazing so far and I really feel like i'm in college compared to Galen. The students are great and easy to get along with. Christ has been very helpful and quick with feedback. They have great programs to help students outside of school. Although the tuition is expensive, I believe I made a good choice by transferring here. The only thing I would change about this school is the scholarships that are offered and the qualifications for each. Overall I give this school a 5 star review. I was able to convince my cousin to transfer to Christ as well as another colleague from Galen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-10-04T21:35:40.417728Z","guid":"bf71f928-2686-4266-83c5-d57d03a978d3","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4c0024e4b13c001cf7a22e5d9f67a2096ff6b75c.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63e47fcb68dc39edf1641ba3673a7155cc479a1d.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4c0024e4b13c001cf7a22e5d9f67a2096ff6b75c.jpg"},"guid":"3fbe06e4-ed32-4f9a-83ba-6d8afeb6b3d0","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.509237,39.12072,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.509237,39.12072,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"c9a74f91-e62d-4e4d-b8e5-549fc84119d0","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.3028571428571425,"count":175},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-christ-college-of-nursing-and-health-sciences/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=the-christ-college-of-nursing-and-health-sciences"}]},{"guid":"c744540e-6535-43f1-8912-3034041b7779","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":748,"total":1517,"vanityURL":"best-colleges","photoURLs":{"desktop":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_2048.png","mobile":"https://d33a4decm84gsn.cloudfront.net/search/2024/colleges/colleges-best_640.png"}},"content":{"centroid":{"lat":47.244967,"lon":-122.437499},"entity":{"abbreviation":"UW Tacoma","alternates":{"ipeds":"377564"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"c744540e-6535-43f1-8912-3034041b7779","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"TACOMA, WA","name":"University of Washington - Tacoma","parentGUIDs":{"college":"f5464544-1058-40ec-a8be-41422b38bd6c","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"722f3481-6e8f-4ceb-928b-81e0f2db4d80","gradSchool":"08ff3b6b-4fc1-4adc-82cd-0e85d1867915","metroArea":"6023ccf7-09a4-4571-8543-3d06a201095e","neighborhood":"7517e3f4-8fdf-436f-834a-dc329e6eb18a","parent":"f5464544-1058-40ec-a8be-41422b38bd6c","state":"95b0bd28-1551-4c12-9876-7abb43198184","town":"f4f1b7ea-1f82-455d-a074-f8cca8a688ef","zipCode":"2358b52e-6a86-444a-960a-dad7aba07bcc"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"UW Tacoma","tagline":["4 Year","TACOMA, WA"],"type":"College","url":"university-of-washington-tacoma","variation":1006},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8834853090172239},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10680},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"960-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The University of Washington is richly diverse, especially with the student body and the professors.

Outside of this, the area is the most negative part of the university, with my safety as a woman often times being a concern, being planted within the heart of Tacoma allows for large amounts of diversity and vast history, but it also is known for large amounts of homelessness, sometimes making it a little scary when walking to class.

Central is a great place for a young person to grow and thrive. The university has wonderful professors. They will get to know you, you are not just a face in the crowd at Central! With a student body of about 1200 they offer smaller class sizes yet still the campus has a feel and excitement of the college experience you are looking for. Always something to be a part of and people to get to know throughout the year.  The dorms are cozy and safe with well taken care of and sizeable rooms. Affordable tuition and many scholarship opportunities available to help lower costs even more.

With such a low student l to faculty ratio, I felt like I could connect with my professors on a personal level. They always made themselves available for questions, whether during office hours or after class, which made a huge difference in my learning experience. The community at Moravian is incredible. It’s easy to form strong connections with both peers and professors, which created a welcoming and supportive environment. I always felt like I belonged, and that sense of community made it easier to get involved in various activities and feel at home on campus. The campus itself is a beautiful mix of old and new. The professors at Moravian are deeply committed to their students' success. I had professors who went above and beyond to help me outside of class, offering extra office hours or involving me in research projects. They were genuinely interested in my progress and wanted to see me succeed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-04T00:06:01.867849Z","guid":"9c8e963f-5fcd-41f1-b71a-cf6a035cccdd","helpfulness":1,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/362d38d44e7893fb904ed53b4e07bd3867a7474f","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/819ca561d858e890354364d6db31e0659469a829","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24638c0926497b13733200149a46482db10a13b2","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6ada0157333c2cb54e75a9e03b36cb724c1333ec"},"guid":"eb9afeca-867a-4a65-84b5-ba3759c3f7ed","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-07T19:23:23.621483Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/75cb6e0d13b4280c821feaee97d067eba6fb1596"},"guid":"426c4a97-540e-4111-a252-7bc58f0646e6","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-02-21T02:32:59.783348Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.380979,40.630888,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.380979,40.630888,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"51925578-b1e6-496b-869c-2f2ef80910e1","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6834264432029795,"count":537},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.moravian.edu/admission-all#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/moravian-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=moravian-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.moravian.edu/admission-all#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"2b312623-ad6e-4931-b97b-12e4376ec13a","content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.243204,"lon":-75.88833},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Wilkes","alternates":{"ceeb":"2977","ipeds":"216931"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"2b312623-ad6e-4931-b97b-12e4376ec13a","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"WILKES-BARRE, PA","name":"Wilkes University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"2e2b0074-eaf6-45f8-800a-440bb6fcb657","gradSchool":"3c8e0e17-d5bf-440f-bda0-c696f01583eb","metroArea":"e6068a69-3a78-47d6-8a05-ee65f9915dfc","state":"53fbb7b5-6943-466d-b2f1-f55c3ef2ce81","town":"f14e93cc-34dd-44a6-a60b-622ae8d31b98","zipCode":"64332305-cf7f-4c84-8fe7-7a91a56ead68"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Wilkes","tagline":["4 Year","WILKES-BARRE, PA"],"type":"College","url":"wilkes-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.9414339308045019},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":27918},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1060-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My time at Wilkes University was filled with numerous opportunities and very helpful resources.

Because it is a small campus, you have a better relationship with your fellow peers, and your professors.\nMy overall experience has been good, and I plan to spend my four years at Pfeiffer!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-10-30T00:57:04.132648Z","guid":"497b7b3c-d60a-4e3c-b901-db828096e052","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/16e32f087f88a9fc51ed70c3c6665236e74ab097.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a40ee072d0383bf27c25e85f5a62377b4d107e97.jpg","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/16e32f087f88a9fc51ed70c3c6665236e74ab097.jpg"},"guid":"eef7c54e-82fe-449b-af60-ecb13e9d1bff","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.283168,35.484696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.283168,35.484696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"d12323f8-df50-4f45-8c5c-0748856a76ba","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.404109589041096,"count":292},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pfeiffer-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=pfeiffer-university"}]},{"guid":"d94ca754-7539-4e98-828c-989058f17976","content":{"centroid":{"lat":36.104149,"lon":-79.505632},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Elon","alternates":{"ceeb":"5183","ipeds":"198516"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"d94ca754-7539-4e98-828c-989058f17976","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"ELON, NC","name":"Elon University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ab8cef45-5e13-430b-a4e1-f1f4550fac27","gradSchool":"18de4a1b-7161-4989-aa01-5cf3d0a55358","metroArea":"0f89224c-4b89-4948-b0c6-d86de9dce3f5","state":"6c719699-2dd3-4c44-9fc0-2d38b35cc1c8","town":"c57dd89b-dd0b-4c0b-a9b0-7bc7e1de11e7","zipCode":"84e22b52-c313-4d82-9e5e-febe5d00770d"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Elon","tagline":["4 Year","ELON, NC"],"type":"College","url":"elon-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7446299356162042},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":41527},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1170-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Elon University is an amazing institution and I could not imagine myself anywhere else. It is incredibly well run and wants every student to succeed. It is very innovative and there are many opportunities for you to grow. They have options for everyone to get involved if you go to the organization fair (well over 200 student run organizations). It is also very easy to create your own if you do not see a club for you, which I did. Elon University's job center wants you to get a good internship/job and will help you to find that. The study abroad opportunities are fantastic ways to grow, meet new people, and see new places. The academics are fantastic and the professors want to see you succeed. The campus is beyond beautiful and on a warm, sunny day you will see everyone hanging out outside with their friends. The campus is very safe.

The amount of support I’ve received has been wonderful, and I feel like I’ve made close connections to every member I meet.

Transferring from a bigger university and a bigger school this was very different. The professors here give you undivided attention whereas in bigger schools you don't get that opportunity.

With being a commuter student, I've found many places around campus that allow me to study or even wait for my next class. I also like how they offer a great variety of classes and you're able to take different courses before deciding on your major.

From feeling like I should give up to having an emotional and physical family to uplift my time here. Before entering the university I pursued their bridge program “Summer Rise”! Coming in I felt anxious due to the fact that I was alone and started “school” two weeks early. The program offered a class session during this time in which we pick out our own groups and ultimately created a project for others to see! On that last day I knew that this school was going to be my forever home. Only four days later and was already heading back to live on campus. First semester was a the battle! From trying to afford the living expenses, working and all still being a full time student. Luckily I had the best friends and family around me that allowed me to push without having to drop due to financials. I am now back home commuting, and can say my family back at East bay will always have my back, that’s just who they are!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-21T07:56:24.725432Z","guid":"ba894a1e-54ea-4ff1-9231-2da81de7c40e","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/77ba91b3d7c1f30f034e8abac80fda27d54289c7","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f484689d01c74ea622810d4835566cca3a81a281","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a54641b2d9c1c6725bb315f11be8ff4730be4ffa","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ec22f94eccbd8bc60343a38dd26718c69173162"},"guid":"8e850b44-514e-4a58-80ad-bfd227dd6db5","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-18T18:46:09.781293Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d90856a4e94a10e710668d6f8ed327cf0e64e26"},"guid":"f0a52379-b27a-4a6c-a65a-32affa221219","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-17T02:56:07.718379Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.058073,37.65707,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.058073,37.65707,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"2a210553-f562-4974-95bb-4b0902ca6b41","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e56f0cf4d0fce1d1309676659d1802329c1ef711","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8e3fee993bfa7514a88e6525e2258656bb846183"},"guid":"282cdabf-3018-4881-858c-8b52b4094882","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-10-17T07:45:13.739625Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5758024691358026,"count":2025},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/csueastbay/143999?pl=v&m_prompt=1"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university-east-bay/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-state-university-east-bay"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.youvisit.com/tour/csueastbay/143999?pl=v&m_prompt=1"}]},{"guid":"dc1370cf-bf67-4e0b-92fe-32f27f45ea71","content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.584879,"lon":-77.001662},"entity":{"abbreviation":"McDaniel","alternates":{"ceeb":"5898","ipeds":"164270"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"dc1370cf-bf67-4e0b-92fe-32f27f45ea71","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"WESTMINSTER, MD","name":"McDaniel College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"41318db3-7825-4d26-a685-8e3bfb144981","gradSchool":"1ab1d650-ba6f-413d-9e26-0957654df752","state":"695ce602-38b9-45be-95e7-6646da7cffd8","town":"590c9ce7-d8bd-40af-a899-2cde554afdd1","zipCode":"79233523-e9cb-44e3-826d-f354d8a144ec"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"McDaniel","tagline":["4 Year","WESTMINSTER, MD"],"type":"College","url":"mcdaniel-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8204592901878914},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":23733},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1050-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I will say that my overall experience with McDaniel College has been good.

There is also a lot to get involved in at the school as well!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-11T00:34:35.05116Z","guid":"13320c59-48fb-4924-b147-1172adfd178a","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b4b0b4fc325b42ba40e7a12f276e9b5d03a194bb","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8db20fa09af8d6f5beeff467326ca5a7c0cfa257","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/44876fd48964d98561fc902df3ead1d70495cddc","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/31905c7d5f1c11db79318b263d2354b5701bbe93"},"guid":"dcfd1d1a-29d9-4821-b6f6-81a2db1ab420","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-28T14:07:59.3499Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3f1110c1b1acc71577e6185ef74cd81a54cd5e0e"},"guid":"f873a72b-522d-4f98-963a-6481d76eb231","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-04-26T15:17:11.634238Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.6693,35.2493,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.6693,35.2493,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"8025a865-a484-4552-ba7a-9d8f74c9fc1b","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ea12be93951d593467fe80abe788cd6c8388c52f","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ea12be93951d593467fe80abe788cd6c8388c52f"},"guid":"9fe549e8-666a-4db6-8c3e-e0f257daa9e7","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7167487684729066,"count":812},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://gardner-webb.edu/visit/virtual-tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gardner-webb-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=gardner-webb-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://gardner-webb.edu/visit/virtual-tour/"}]},{"guid":"b73a8620-d11b-48e4-9b92-4123113f1a62","content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.510543,"lon":-87.460126},"entity":{"abbreviation":"SMWC","alternates":{"ceeb":"1704","ipeds":"152381"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":false,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"b73a8620-d11b-48e4-9b92-4123113f1a62","isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"location":"SAINT MARY OF THE WOODS, IN","name":"Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"467d007b-bc08-491c-abf4-4840f1b6296d","gradSchool":"d9de9b02-9c77-4455-ab43-69b3e7184155","state":"ad8b4b4c-f8d2-4015-8b22-c0f002a720bb","town":"7a4ec9eb-5e7f-4a5c-836d-6069ea11d9bd","zipCode":"78b2ad65-ad9c-4e1c-b84e-9939fcf4d403"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Saint Mary-of-the-Woods","tagline":["4 Year","SAINT MARY OF THE WOODS, IN"],"type":"College","url":"saint-mary-of-the-woods-college","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7910135841170324},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":17358},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"890-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Overall I really love the environment that SMWC offers!

It has good academics and some great professors. Some professors aren't, and you will be warned by upperclassmen of any that are bad. The classes are very hard, and this is due to the shortened semesters to allow the co-op program. 11 week (3 month) semesters allow for 4 semesters per year, 2 school and 2 work. You are required to get at least 5 terms of co-op/internship credits, allowing you to graduate with up to 2.5 years of relevant work experience, and it's paid. The party scene is good for a school with 1600 students, and half on campus at a time. This is due to the work term/school term life causing an A-Section and a B-Section. The average class size allows for an abundance of opportunities to have 1-on-1 with professors and get to know them. Overall I think it's a good experience with great campus life and lots of opportunities. But due to it's difficulty and fast pace, it's not for everyone.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-03T19:01:40.971815Z","guid":"0fe9fd56-c178-4f80-9a1c-ebb0ebc6cb94","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ecc04b9eeb3bc83a91152ae445ac449b8e582fb","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aa9e147c05f76d66136f1c56e8a5b789fda4b367","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8c6499aeb928c9169a28bcd91a53f5b94afdb696","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb8dd893dfd3e2459cd8784c337ec69d299e96d5"},"guid":"c90cb413-5f26-4e94-8ec5-25e1aed1c274","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-08T20:58:08.661669Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/62241a81bceef0ab8edfa58016364e67785470a0"},"guid":"8de7c78b-b1a0-4c45-84aa-4f9873083a26","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-06-28T20:00:55.527474Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.714356,43.013112,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.714356,43.013112,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"87e49181-df27-4f8b-8cbf-115b4c7a5dc0","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bb5183858dac7a6b97e0cfa61823481f68701e3b","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6e08871c78c2bf2036d234c2589ad2c930fa3678"},"guid":"453564e6-8101-41c2-a7d3-5ede0f8e3f5e","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-05-08T21:03:03.495037Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6371100164203614,"count":609},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.kettering.edu/visit/virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kettering-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=kettering-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.kettering.edu/visit/virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"7ddc5498-856a-4ed9-91ff-8db68d4672cb","content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.162473,"lon":-80.604054},"entity":{"abbreviation":"WLU","alternates":{"ipeds":"237932"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"7ddc5498-856a-4ed9-91ff-8db68d4672cb","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"WEST LIBERTY, WV","name":"West Liberty University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"6f694b4f-99b4-4a8d-aee7-03c68c1e6c72","gradSchool":"14c1b04a-5c61-481f-8b5d-df4a7df0d477","state":"f0d7046d-0e9b-4ad0-8104-5958adfb5a80","town":"e70e3457-9764-416e-82cd-1103e5c4f847","zipCode":"ce6daa96-e131-45c2-b3a8-2d4576945ec3"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"West Liberty","tagline":["4 Year","WEST LIBERTY, WV"],"type":"College","url":"west-liberty-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.7409144196951934},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":13788},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"900-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I transferred from a community college to West Liberty in Fall 2024.

It's not too big for me and it's surrounded by tons of trees which makes the atmosphere welcoming. The town is within walking distance which is nice. I can go off campus with my friends even though I don't have a car. However, it would be nice if the school offered a shuttle into town. That would be helpful for students that work off campus. Drew offers a vast array of majors to choose from. I plan on completing a double major with Performing Arts and Psychology. I was so excited to audition (and get a role) in my very first college play. The play was, You're A Good Man Charlie Brown. In high school I was the lead but in college I was a singer in the ensemble. It was great! Drew's classes are small which encourages great discussions. Also, the professors are very approachable and provide detailed and helpful feedback on class work. I was almost in tears from the encouraging comments my theater professor gave on my papers. I definitely geeked out!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-05T14:21:43.447063Z","guid":"8b4eda86-ed79-4378-91ee-c1cbb1844334","helpfulness":1,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5b4ceb65cab3c9312948a1bf795dd4e8daf9e519","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aecdce97d35941ffed609dbbee59582d503c1955","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f57fd6640c534685b1143a3175167fb8fbdd9dfa","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2c66bef9027c0c6215ee495d0760025abe50563d"},"guid":"f339079c-529d-43a7-acf3-7c17f06f422b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-03-27T21:01:57.341445Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7ce84081ddc189fe76e5fe348fb6fb5eb4b5ca71"},"guid":"3ad29c8e-1443-4943-ab05-24285105dd5f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-07T15:19:47.532348Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.425825,40.757026,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.425825,40.757026,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"fe163165-2138-46e7-acce-aef00923e850","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f2b03a74154af1bb6b611fff8ee1c174ce18a3d8","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f4d8c1813ab38c64ae0b8de4374530836a0e0965"},"guid":"1a3a3510-6b66-4f98-a735-fc6c52e9d456","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-12-11T16:14:18.111913Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5175292153589317,"count":599},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.drew.edu/tour/"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/drew-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=drew-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.drew.edu/tour/"}]},{"guid":"8dcb6bd6-02a8-4782-8f36-4824db040238","content":{"centroid":{"lat":42.864108,"lon":-112.429084},"entity":{"abbreviation":"ISU","alternates":{"ceeb":"4355","ipeds":"142276"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"8dcb6bd6-02a8-4782-8f36-4824db040238","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"POCATELLO, ID","name":"Idaho State University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"ac28e22b-207e-4a10-8bfd-20aca9e07de1","gradSchool":"07b52bb5-6fd6-401a-9724-83adc8a6101a","state":"62e50d35-04b0-4d45-946c-4f754a822d13","town":"ecfce622-6485-452f-bc35-845f09448b16","zipCode":"505497e5-64c9-4079-a13f-61dbf4ea8690"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Idaho State","tagline":["4 Year","POCATELLO, ID"],"type":"College","url":"idaho-state-university","variation":4},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":12425},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Idaho State University is the perfect fit for me.

I most appreciated that I was able to design my own degree, and I pursued my Bachelor's as an independent study of multiple areas of interest, then graduated on my own time table, which was about 1.5 years vs. 4 years at another typical school. My experience involved one-on-one mentorship with professors, and internships off campus. I was also able to join campus groups and that helped make the 'college experience' more real with lots of positive new connections.

Only problem I faced was the speed of everything going on for me in classes, starting the semester out, and even choosing my major since I never knew much about college or how different it works compared to high school or even other universities now that I’m realizing the environment is different at every university. My advice for any freshman looking to get into this college is to make sure to have an idea of what you want to become and make sure it’s a good one because the couple choices you make here at the beginning of your college journey can waste people’s money, time, and energy but luckily people here are truly willing to help you if you put in the effort. If there was something I could change it would be more advice or method for college students that could give them a strong idea of what they’re naturally inclined to become.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-11-14T18:43:31.313284Z","guid":"28de0bc2-1e4e-4ed3-8466-65021f2c17e6","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2d0b87b1b41e52eb3d3d118f5884e1feed00687d","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c71ab9fc106f19e5c8e81b87c0c376c2200d2194","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bf1d3aea3bac67567621db20957c13724a238a0f","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9df26d8c5b9ee86ee669369b4ecaccdf76dc21e8"},"guid":"041cf1b8-ca9a-4f42-b698-145ce4932c7a","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-27T22:28:40.17199Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5f0e09d21bc9db4ccc2ca67883bdfd8ffbe63af9"},"guid":"6620efd3-619c-4c89-a4bc-bed221b2b48f","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-02-27T19:58:59.996068Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"22697430-0d3d-49cb-9360-87afef5021c3","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6206322795341097,"count":1202},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university-kingsville/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=texas-a-and-m-university-kingsville"}]},{"guid":"abbaef9a-1b7a-4573-957d-321987911bd3","content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.7550873,"lon":-73.979261},"entity":{"abbreviation":"LIM","alternates":{"ipeds":"192271"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"abbaef9a-1b7a-4573-957d-321987911bd3","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEW YORK, NY","name":"LIM College","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"510ffa3e-a740-4fc0-9626-13343de3d1f0","gradSchool":"bba4f353-bc46-42f2-8eab-ff575c8672c4","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"1cec43e3-dcb9-433c-8fc7-39ef2bf51f8c","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"be4375aa-a7b8-433d-9864-a8f40bc9dcc1","zipCode":"2cd786ba-0319-441d-96de-a05898016114"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"LIM","tagline":["4 Year","NEW YORK, NY"],"type":"College","url":"lim-college","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8381706244503079},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":39020},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"970-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I am receiving a great education at LIM College.

McMurry definitely delivers on this, making you feel like you are more than just a statistic in the school, as Professors notice when you don't show up, and do a good job of following up with you.  Student life is not very active after classes because half of the students live off campus due to some of the more questionable housing options, and most do not spend an exorbitant amount of time on campus. This can lead to the campus feeling empty and is one of the downsides of residing on campus. McMurry, being a smaller school, suffers from funding issues in some areas such as the dining hall, which doesn't always have the most quality food- though it arguably makes up for it with its personal and friendly staff. McMurry is not a perfect campus, but with these changes the school can most definitely have many selling points.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-04T00:02:38.59828Z","guid":"b3f523d5-282d-448f-b989-a939b78a21e9","helpfulness":0,"rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/474656874d8686bfe58cdd34a60e2eb833d5e6ab","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/026093115064db01f5f701fa3e6020e22622a5d1","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/474656874d8686bfe58cdd34a60e2eb833d5e6ab","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1a2d42b247bbc884e6f1147b61af7aaf9007868c"},"guid":"e4d92e25-0e4c-409e-9fbf-1f122c5f36d3","licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e5c36c238b2c2d70554e6af501008ec89fb6be3d"},"guid":"acf51294-412e-40b0-90bc-2ab9c0775321","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-03-31T16:15:11.187015Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.750351,32.430299,13/900x340@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.750351,32.430299,13/400x175@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"281d7321-48a7-4c68-ab89-eb30641eca74","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bda2b53a90fc45830acfc17d11178a20215fdb1c","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/633458ea082f95c67901d0a63c5aef797e5b1f85"},"guid":"f621fee2-22f6-4b2d-a2e4-93e2a55848c2","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-01-02T18:09:24.325393Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.764411027568922,"count":399},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://mcm.edu/admissions-overview/campus-tours/#virtualtour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mcmurry-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=mcmurry-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://mcm.edu/admissions-overview/campus-tours/#virtualtour"}]},{"guid":"62662d31-badd-4e5a-aeca-7326a8a4bfeb","content":{"centroid":{"lat":39.996635,"lon":-81.737192},"entity":{"abbreviation":"Muskingum","alternates":{"ceeb":"1496","ipeds":"204264"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"62662d31-badd-4e5a-aeca-7326a8a4bfeb","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEW CONCORD, OH","name":"Muskingum University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"600b8231-86ae-48c9-a4a6-37412f5df443","gradSchool":"29850b63-f509-43d3-9e6b-baa479a13906","state":"e22ca9b6-60b3-461e-b905-42a3e83cbeb2","town":"d937a50d-d98f-451c-bf60-1046ec5fa636","zipCode":"12a8d79c-8901-472a-ba9d-99b25b80d0d0"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Muskingum","tagline":["4 Year","NEW CONCORD, OH"],"type":"College","url":"muskingum-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8639405204460967},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":19682},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"950-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Muskingum is a great place to be.

The professors and staff are extremely nice, take care to remember you and go out of their way to make sure everything is good. The atmosphere is great. Everyone laments to dining hall food, it is not good, but there are still other meal options. Freshman honors housing is pitiful. As a freshman it is very difficult to get a campus job or classes you want, though that's how it goes in most colleges. There are many internship opportunities and study abroad is highly encouraged - it used to be mandatory. There are a lot of good clubs, student writing organizations and a good creative writing program. The honors program counts as an additional minor, which is strange, and requires you to take more classes that might not be related to your major. Overall Susquehanna feels like a second home to me and I'm glad I ended up there rather than anywhere else.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2024-12-28T00:54:34.157164Z","guid":"3e82163c-f683-4940-8ff2-b31497d24a50","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fc9be44a4012d8cddbe9a7609f4083d50cfe2d7f","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/011957624b05f9d877375587057c779b82614e84","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f244bd886a31fe41e5f6dbe4c5c04d242cb435f9","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a1ce6e568ad96c1dbe8ae9b6c9b8330a7ccfa97c"},"guid":"bf1fda75-1119-41b5-88ba-fbb376c8f5e1","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2025-03-03T17:38:09.47184Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4c6397f33d4d85b0322a45cc0be8ab170e7896c4"},"guid":"672ccdd9-0654-449b-9ee0-83374c3a9bb4","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-10T21:19:04.774396Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.87521,40.79774,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.87521,40.79774,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"cc1d3939-e82e-45c5-9d77-814d29554f81","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1b9b3ac91ff5866d07e4742db671d7a3e39dfa7","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/879a0d533b64422879a8e7866a6954306d1b14a8"},"guid":"e569155c-13f0-4e8e-b95c-8a278a2935e9","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2023-06-01T16:42:46.292076Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.62119503945885,"count":887},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.susqu.edu/virtual-tour"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/susquehanna-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=susquehanna-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.susqu.edu/virtual-tour"}]},{"guid":"dc2a3c04-3c0f-4e8a-9ca8-9938f1c67eaf","content":{"centroid":{"lat":33.4898106,"lon":-94.1036731},"entity":{"abbreviation":"TAMUT","alternates":{"ceeb":"6206","ipeds":"224545"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"dc2a3c04-3c0f-4e8a-9ca8-9938f1c67eaf","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"location":"TEXARKANA, TX","name":"Texas A&M University - Texarkana","parentGUIDs":{"college":"5d77fe05-4d2c-4a08-8507-3a29885b7739","country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"fd09d7d8-1ba0-4d4e-8522-2f71d6482fbd","gradSchool":"80fccf94-d2e3-4064-8f35-b24ce39a5815","parent":"5d77fe05-4d2c-4a08-8507-3a29885b7739","state":"e82829bf-d2ab-445a-8f4c-7031cf1c4eac","town":"455a8449-af98-42e8-8f8a-b5a955b39b51","zipCode":"460e92e3-0bc6-41f7-acf9-5ba8fff7cc6c"},"premium":false,"published":true,"shortName":"Texas A&M - Texarkana","tagline":["4 Year","TEXARKANA, TX"],"type":"College","url":"texas-a-and-m-university-texarkana","variation":6},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.915136476426799},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":10646},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"950-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Texas A&M University, known for its rich traditions and strong sense of community, stands out as one of the leading institutions in the United States.

Overall, I absolutely enjoyed studying here, and I’ll always have fond memories of this campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-01-16T00:49:22.477957Z","guid":"937a9276-7bb7-4c00-b665-ba373785e2e7","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.492709,42.733936,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.492709,42.733936,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"e8beac61-c2f1-4960-b28b-0acbe6fbc4b4","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.614019520851819,"count":1127},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin-platteville/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-wisconsin-platteville"}]},{"guid":"c22feca2-515f-4ae6-84a0-fe2af91f6c4b","content":{"centroid":{"lat":41.4197818,"lon":-72.8915502},"entity":{"abbreviation":"QU","alternates":{"ceeb":"3712","ipeds":"130226"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"c22feca2-515f-4ae6-84a0-fe2af91f6c4b","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"HAMDEN, CT","name":"Quinnipiac University","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"14d8f8f0-3dcc-4461-a74d-8a6090b2c712","gradSchool":"bef2add3-a6f1-4fce-b4d7-74d275785164","state":"37169cde-9039-4b96-a2c5-8c385ef2c504","town":"cc7ffb50-e5a3-4d06-aa6e-89928f14ca77","zipCode":"5478484e-a274-4f05-ab9d-a76339a42e90"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"Quinnipiac","tagline":["4 Year","HAMDEN, CT"],"type":"College","url":"quinnipiac-university","variation":1004},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.8378508677951575},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":39051},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1120-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"As a first-year graduate student at Quinnipiac University, I appreciate the supportive community and dedicated faculty who genuinely care about student success.

I love the close community and the supportive environment. The smaller class sizes allowed me to form meaningful relationships with professors, who are always willing to help. The campus is beautiful, and there are plenty of resources, like the library and study spaces, that make it easy to focus on my studies. Plus, the variety of clubs and organizations has given me the chance to explore my interests and meet new people.  However, I think there are a few areas where Cal Lutheran could improve. I'd love to see more events that celebrate the diverse cultures and backgrounds of the student body. This would help everyone feel more included and represented. Additionally, expanding mental health resources would be beneficial, especially during stressful times like exams. Lastly, implementing more sustainability initiatives, like recycling programs and eco-friendly dining options, could make a positive impact on the campus environment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2025-03-12T23:46:26.729666Z","guid":"9520863f-95b4-46e4-b19b-5cfdcdb257ec","helpfulness":0,"rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ade421a2c480fccf843dde98fe31b1d3c8e7ff67","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5c3bb9c04ebeb3045c961997ea4f51824892a13d","Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42b1ed943679021121bc7433f5185460a727b646","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9864b39c5a477c04520bbd4897b1096e645b47cc"},"guid":"778404d4-95f5-4031-ab0f-900a9b10d13b","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2024-11-26T19:01:37.128756Z"},"editorial":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0195267d2d9edd037284749bb4db45146ca7aa28"},"guid":"4f4508e9-15ae-4fa0-961e-ca6b2a67e23c","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-02-09T21:06:19.690286Z"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.879467,34.225551,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.879467,34.225551,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"guid":"3e4edbdc-bdaa-4022-90af-bde7c98db895","licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"},"spotlight":{"crops":{"Original":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/19384522cc6af7e4f0bbcd11be2a24366592985a","Spotlight":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1fe704b7f0420703c8a3d8ba3dffd74525a22bf1"},"guid":"7642193e-5979-4b9e-b845-a4d77b8dcc09","licenseName":"UNLICENSED","uploadTimestamp":"2022-06-23T16:40:31.17301Z"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.814662273476112,"count":1214},"virtualTour":[{"label":"Virtual Tour","name":"VirtualTourUrl","value":"https://www.callutheran.edu/tour/?utm_source=niche.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Niche-Profile"}]},"ctas":[{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-lutheran-university/#scatterplot"},{"label":"Compare","type":"compare","url":"/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=california-lutheran-university"},{"label":"Virtual Tour","type":"virtualTour","url":"https://www.callutheran.edu/tour/?utm_source=niche.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Niche-Profile"}]},{"guid":"c80defd8-cb74-4e65-899e-5fd27a339e5e","content":{"centroid":{"lat":40.735275,"lon":-73.994636},"entity":{"abbreviation":"TNS","alternates":{"ceeb":"2521","ipeds":"193654"},"character":"4 Year","claimed":true,"displayable":true,"genus":"College","guid":"c80defd8-cb74-4e65-899e-5fd27a339e5e","isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"location":"NEW YORK, NY","name":"The New School","parentGUIDs":{"country":"f931a1cd-e1b4-44bb-9e2c-b0d3e9241e98","county":"510ffa3e-a740-4fc0-9626-13343de3d1f0","gradSchool":"971197b8-d190-4e67-9bcb-0db4283ab165","metroArea":"9b68e2cd-0da9-4ec6-ac31-33e2d89920aa","neighborhood":"2130e688-ed58-4d80-a76b-f0e9cfbd61eb","state":"820bdb36-718f-42a2-a471-5e2aa98007da","town":"be4375aa-a7b8-433d-9864-a8f40bc9dcc1","zipCode":"d712fb85-a961-4d37-acef-7298ce8fb906"},"premium":true,"published":true,"shortName":"New School","tagline":["4 Year","NEW YORK, NY"],"type":"College","url":"the-new-school","variation":1005},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","name":"AcceptRate","value":0.5699045480067377},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","name":"NetPrice","value":55480},{"label":"SAT Range","name":"SATCompRange","value":"1140-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I went to The New School for my 5-year undergraduate dual-degree program in Illustration and Literary Studies, with a minor in Psychology.
